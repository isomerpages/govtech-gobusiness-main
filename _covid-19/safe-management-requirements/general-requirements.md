## General requirements

To ensure a safe working environment, businesses are required to abide by the [nation-wide general requirements for workplaces](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. Businesses are also required to adhere to the [sector-specific requirements](/safemanagement/sector/), and comply with [measures to facilitate contact tracing](/safemanagement/safeentry/).

All businesses should take note of the following:

- From 19 August 2021, temperature screening and symptom checks are no longer required at workplaces.

- Employers must ensure that no more than 50% of employees who are able to work from home are at the workplace at any point in time, regardless of their vaccination status.

- Employers should continue to stagger start times of employees who need to return to the workplace and implement flexible working hours.

- Social gatherings at the workplace will not be allowed. Employees should have their meal breaks at the workplace individually.

- From 8 September 2021, if an employee tests positive for COVID-19 and was at the workplace on any of the past 7 days, the employer must implement a snap 14-day work-from-home regime for all employees who are able to do so.

- Any applicable sector-specific requirements
