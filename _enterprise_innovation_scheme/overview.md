### Innovation Projects carried out with Polytechnics, the ITE or other qualified partners

Businesses undertaking innovation projects that are capital in nature and do not meet the definition of R&D under Section 2 of the Income Tax Act, may be eligible for tax deductions if these projects are qualifying innovation projects carried out with the polytechnics, the ITE or other qualified partners (collectively known as “partner institutions”). 

Qualifying innovation projects refer to projects that predominantly involve one or more of the following innovation activities defined within the Oslo Manual 2018:

    a. Research and experimental development activities;

    b. Engineering, design and other creative work activities;

    c. IP-related activities; and

    d. Software development and database activities.

This scheme will be administered by the partner institutions. The partner institutions will validate the project as a qualifying innovation project and issue the innovation project invoice. Expenditure incurred outside of the collaboration with the partner institutions will not qualify for this tax deduction. 

Businesses seeking to undertake qualifying innovation projects may contact the respective partner institutions for more information.

**Note:**

- From 1 Sep 2022 to 31 Mar 2024, companies will be able to submit applications for the purchase of energy efficient equipment through the Business Grants Portal (BGP).

- Companies will have up to 1 year from the time an application is approved to purchase and install the equipment and submit claims for reimbursement.

- This pre-approved energy efficient equipment listing is not to be taken as a form of endorsement or recommendation by the participating government agencies. Companies are reminded to carry out due diligence when engaging vendors, and not to share their Corppass with the vendors to carry out submission of any grant applications or claims.
