<H3>Application Details</H3>

<ol>
<li><strong>How do I pay for the licence fees? </strong><br />Only e-Payment (e.g. VISA, MasterCard, and American Express), GIRO payment and Government e-invoicing will be accepted. Fees paid or submitted are non-refundable. For more information regarding payment method, please refer to the NEA webpage on <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/radiation-safety/guidelines-for-licence-application" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guidelines for Licence Application</a>.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>How do I change the mailing / billing address or point of contact(s) (e.g. name, contact number and e-mail address) associated with my radiation licences? </strong><br />Through the "Customer Profile and Worker Management eService" on NEA ePortal, radiation protection licensees, radiation workers and radiation service customers will be able to create, view and update customer profiles (e.g. update contact person details). Organisations or individuals can update the details within their customer profile at any time at no cost. You are strongly encouraged to ensure that customer profile details are kept up-to-date.

<li><strong>How do I identify an inspector from NEA/RPNSG? </strong><br />All RPNSG officers performing on-site inspection will carry the NEA staff pass and an authority card which allows them to exercise the power and the duties as stated in the Radiation Protection Act and its subsidiary Regulations.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>How do I import or export irradiating apparatus without going through a local vendor or supplier? </strong><br />A licence is required for the import or export of a consignment of irradiating apparatus and the licence should be applied through Singapore Customs' TradeNet system. This is usually done by declaring agents which handle the Customs permit declaration of cargoes moving in and out of Singapore. If you are importing or exporting the irradiating apparatus without going through a local vendor or supplier (e.g. purchasing directly from overseas manufacturer, sale to overseas customer), you have to ensure that an N2 application has been submitted for the possession of the irradiating apparatus (for import) or that there is a valid N2 licence for the irradiating apparatus (for export). The declaring agents should indicate the N2 application/licence number in the permit declartion to facilitate the import or export. <br /><br />For more information, please refer to the NEA webpage on <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/radiation-safety/application-for-licence-to-import-or-export-irradiating-apparatus-and-radioactive-materials/how-to-apply-for-licence-to-import-or-export" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How to Apply for Licence to Import or Export</a>.<br /><br /></li>
