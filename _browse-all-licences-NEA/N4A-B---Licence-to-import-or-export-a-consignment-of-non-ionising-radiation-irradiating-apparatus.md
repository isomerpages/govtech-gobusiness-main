<li><strong>I need more details about licence for importing and exporting a consignment of non-ionising radiation irradiating apparatus.

This is usually done by declaring agents which handle the Customs permit declaration of cargoes moving in and out of Singapore. The importers/exporters should ensure that their N1 licences are valid and have been updated to include the irradiating apparatus.
