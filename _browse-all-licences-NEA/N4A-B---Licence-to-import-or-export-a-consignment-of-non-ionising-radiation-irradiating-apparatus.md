<li><strong>I need more details about licence for importing and exporting a consignment of non-ionising radiation irradiating apparatus. Where can I find it? </strong><br />A licence is required for the import or export of a consignment of irradiating apparatus and the licence should be applied through Singapore Customs' TradeNet system. This is usually done by declaring agents which handle the Customs permit declaration of cargoes moving in and out of Singapore. The importers/exporters should ensure that their N1 licences are valid and have been updated to include the irradiating apparatus.
