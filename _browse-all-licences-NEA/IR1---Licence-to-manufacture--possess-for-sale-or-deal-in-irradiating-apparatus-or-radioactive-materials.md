<li><strong>I need more details about import and export licence.

This is usually done by declaring agents which handle the Customs permit declaration of cargoes moving in and out of Singapore. The importers/exporters should ensure that their IR1 licences are valid and have been updated to include the irradiating apparatus/radioactive materials.

<li><strong>Do I need a licence to use irradiating apparatus or radioactive materials? </strong><br />Any individual, who is engaged in or is employed for part or whole of the individual's working time to do radiation work, must have a valid R1 certificate to handle any radioactive materials or operate any irradiating apparatus under this application.<br /><br /></li>
