<li><strong>I need more details about licence for importing and exporting a consignment of radioactive materials. Where can I find it? </strong><br />A licence is required for the import or export of a consignment of irradiating apparatus and radioactive materials and the licence should be applied through Singapore Customs' TradeNet system. This is usually done by declaring agents which handle the Customs permit declaration of cargoes moving in and out of Singapore. The importers/exporters should ensure that their IR1 licences are valid and have been updated to include the irradiating apparatus/radioactive materials. For more information, please refer to the NEA webpage on <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/radiation-safety/information-on-licence-to-import-or-export-irradiating-apparatus-and-radioactive-materials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Information on Licence to Import or Export Irradiating Apparatus and Radioactive Materials</a>.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Who can I contact for further details regarding import or export of radioactive materials? </strong><br />For licensing enquiries, please contact the Radiation Protection and Nuclear Science Group (RPNSG) of the National Environment Agency (NEA) via <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/corporate-functions/feedback" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NEA's Online Feedback Form</a> or myENV app.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Who can I contact for further details regarding transit or transhipment of nuclear material? </strong><br />Please consult NEA_RPNSD_Tranship_Transit@nea.gov.sg on your eligibility for transit/transhipment of nuclear material under the IAEA Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material before submitting the application.</li>
