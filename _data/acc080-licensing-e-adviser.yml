        The <a href='/gobiz-guides/guide-for-organising-events?src=eservices_guidesforbiz'>Guide for Organising Events</a> provides event organisers with tools to navigate the process of organising events in Singapore such as e-Adviser for Events and Events Proposal Box.

        The Events Proposal Box allows event organisers to propose unique event concepts for collaboration with the government, or seek government endorsements for regulatory approvals. Currently, only proposals for Sporting and MICE events are accepted.

        - <a href='https://go.gov.sg/z6he6v' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Proposal Box for MICE Event</a><br>Submit a proposal for an innovative MICE event that positions Singapore as the choice destination for business tourism. For proposals that include a request for government funding, please find out more about <a href='https://www.stb.gov.sg/content/stb/en/assistance-and-licensing/assistance-and-licensing.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>STB's various assistance schemes</a>.

        - <a href='https://go.gov.sg/7774bj' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Proposal Box for Sport and Fitness Event</a><br>Submit a proposal for a sporting event that could contribute to Singapore's sporting, social, and economic outcomes, or has potential to showcase Singapore as a sporting event host.
