  - title: I've been using GoBusiness Licencing. Can I continue using them?

      Yes, you can still use GoBusiness Licensing while we are in the midst of merging the GoBusiness Singapore and GoBusiness Licensing systems.

      However, as we are eventually moving all licences to GoBusiness Dashboard, we recommend you start using GoBusiness Dashboard instead.
