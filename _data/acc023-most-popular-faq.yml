      GoBusiness is an online platform to connect business owners to various Government e-services and resources. This includes applying for registering a business, applying for licences and grants, and more. Jointly developed by Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI), the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO), and GovTech, it also offers personalised help and recommendations for your business with our [e-Advisers](/e-services/guides-for-biz/?src=most_pop_faq).

      With GoBusiness, you can connect with various Government e-services and resources with the help of these features:

      **e-Advisers:**
      Not sure what your business needs? Find out easily with our [e-Advisers](/e-services/guides-for-biz/?src=most_pop_faq). Simply answer a few questions about your business and get helpful recommendations on grants you can apply for, next steps to start a business, and more.

      **GoBusiness Dashboard:**
      Track and manage all your licence applications in one place. At a glance, you can get an overview of which licences you have and what you need to do next. With the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.gobusiness.gov.sg/login?src=pop_faq){:target="_blank"}, you also get quick access to e-Advisers and other useful resources.

      **e-Service Navigator:**
      Over 300 Government e-services are at your fingertips with the [e-Service Navigator](/e-services/?src=most_pop_faq). An online directory of e-services and resources, it's a fast and easy way to locate what your business needs at a glance.

      **Guided Journey:**
      Designed to help new business owners, Guided Journey is a step-by-step walkthrough to apply for the licences you need. This feature is currently only available for businesses in the [food services industry](https://foodservices.gobusiness.gov.sg/licences/foodservices?src=most_pop_faq){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. We are also working on expanding the Guided Journey feature to help with other tasks such as applying for grants.
      
  - title: I've been using GoBusiness Licencing. Can I continue using them?
    content: |
      Yes, you can still use GoBusiness Licensing while we are in the midst of merging the GoBusiness Singapore and GoBusiness Licensing systems.

      However, as we are eventually moving all licences to GoBusiness Dashboard, we recommend you start using GoBusiness Dashboard instead.
