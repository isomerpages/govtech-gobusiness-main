        SDL on GoBusiness enables employers to perform SDL transactions with SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG). These allow you to:
  
        - Make payment for SDL or declare a non-liability of SDL
        - Apply for a refund of overpaid SDL
        - File a Notice of Objection (NOO)
        - View SDL notification history
        - View SDL payment history
        - Compute actual SDL with online [SDL calculator](https://go.gov.sg/sdlcalculator){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}
        
        For SDL policy-related enquiries, please refer to the [SDL general FAQ](/skills-development-levy-faqs/)

    - title: Should I use GoBusiness or CPF to pay my SDL?
      content: |
        CPF EZPay is for employers to pay for employees' monthly SDL, together with their CPF contributions. You can also use it to pay for foreign employees in the same transaction.

        The SDL payment service on GoBusiness is for employers who have forgotten to pay / underpaid their SDL, or who only have foreign employees.

        If you have received a Notice of Assessment (NOA) or SDL Letter from SSG, do make payments for SDL via GoBusiness by selecting the Relevant Month(s) for the period indicated in the NOA or SDL Letter.

    - title: Who will be able to access SDL on GoBusiness?
      content: |
       Anyone in your organisation who has been granted Corppass access to GoBusiness Dashboard will be able to access SDL on GoBusiness.
    
    - title: How do I access SDL information and perform SDL-related transactions?
      content: |
        1. Inform your Corppass admin about granting access to MTI 'GoBusiness' e-Service for the Corppass account of employees who are authorised to view SDL records
        2. Perform a review of the current users who have access to MTI 'GoBusiness' e-Service' and remove personnel who do not need to access SDL services

    - title: How is the outstanding SDL payable calculated?
      content: |
        Employers can download the monthly breakdown of the SDL payable, SDL paid and estimated outstanding SDL payable from the [SDL page](https://dashboard.gobusiness.gov.sg/sdl){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} via the Download Details button. This will give an overview of how the outstanding SDL payable amount was calculated.
        
        Please review your organisation's payroll records to determine the SDL payable for your local and foreign employees and the amount of SDL you have previously paid for the period.
        
        You may verify your payroll records using the SDL rate of 0.25% of the monthly total wages for each employee<sup>*</sup>, with the minimum payable of $2 (for an employee earning less than $800 a month) and a maximum of $11.25 (for an employee earning more than $4,500 a month) and calculate the SDL payable amount using the SDL calculator.
        
        <sup>*</sup> Please refer to the definition "employee" found in Section 2 of the Skills Development Levy Act 1979.

        If you do not agree with any of the SDL payable in SSG's records, you will be able to correct the amount by filling and submitting the "Declaration Form" template via [SDL Payment & Declaration form](https://dashboard.gobusiness.gov.sg/sdl/make-payment){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} when you receive an SDL Letter for the period. If you agree with all the SDL payable in SSG's records, you may proceed to make payment using the QR code in the letter or via GoBusiness. Please note that you would not be able to submit a Declaration if you have made full payment of the outstanding SDL payable in the SDL Letter.

    - title: How do I make my SDL payment on GoBusiness?
      content: |
        Employers with local employees are encouraged to make their monthly SDL payments together with their CPF contribution through CPF EZPay. 

        Employers should only use GoBusiness to make ad-hoc SDL payments or monthly SDL payments when they do not need to make monthly CPF contributions. Please refer to the [General SDL FAQ](/skills-development-levy-faqs/) for more details and requirements.
