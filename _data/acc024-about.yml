    - title: Why do I see two different websites, GoBusiness Singapore and GoBusiness Licensing?
      content: |
        We are in the midst of merging the GoBusiness Singapore and GoBusiness Licensing systems. During this period, you can still use [GoBusiness Licensing](https://licence1.business.gov.sg/feportal/web/frontier/home){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. to apply for licences and keep track of their statuses.
    
    - title: What will happen to my licences after GoBusiness Singapore and GoBusiness Licensing merge?
      content: |
        You will still be able to find your existing licences on [GoBusiness Licensing](https://licence1.business.gov.sg/feportal/web/frontier/home){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. For licences that are yet to be approved by GoBusiness Licensing, they will appear on GoBusiness Dashboard after they are approved.

    - title: Do I need to do anything during the transition period when GoBusiness Licensing moves to GoBusiness Singapore?
      content: |
        You should complete your licence applications on GoBusiness Licensing during this period.

        We also recommend updating any bookmarked links to [https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/) to ensure the application is submitted through GoBusiness in the future.
    
    - title: Why is the Guided Journey feature only available for F&B businesses?
      content: |
        Guided Journey is being launched in phases, starting with food services businesses. We are currently working towards making it available for more industries.

        In the meantime, you can use our [e-Advisers](/e-services/guides-for-biz/?src=licences_faq) for various business sectors to get recommendations on what to do next.

    - title: How is GoBusiness Dashboard different from GoBusiness Licensing?
      content: |
        GoBusiness Dashboard gives an overview of your Government-to-Business (G2B) transactions in one place, including licences. It also gives personalised recommendations with our e-Advisers, while GoBusiness Licensing is primarily for matters related to licences and permits only.

    - title: I've been using GoBusiness Licensing. Can I continue to use it?
      content: |
        Yes, you can still use GoBusiness Licensing while we are in the midst of merging the GoBusiness Singapore and GoBusiness Licensing systems.

        However, as we are eventually moving all licences to GoBusiness Dashboard, we recommend you start using GoBusiness Dashboard instead.

    - title: Why do I get redirected to another page while filling up an application form?
      content: |
        We are currently experiencing a bug that redirects users to another section within the same page when they click the “Add” button in an addable section of the form. You may refer to the following screenshots to understand better. We apologise for the inconvenience and are currently investigating the issue.

        1. You are filling up an application form.

        2. This is an addable section. To enter your information here, you will need to click on “Add”.
        ![Screenshot of ading a sub-addable row](/images/FAQ/db/JumpingForm2.png)

        3. Upon clicking “Add”, you will see a pop-up at the top right corner indicating your information in the section has been added successfully. However, your cursor gets redirected to another section.

        4. Kindly do not be alarmed and scroll back to the section that you left off from. The GoBusiness team is currently aware of this problem and is working on a solution.
