        An Application Journey shows the correct order to apply for your licences in order to start running your business. It is customized based on your business concept.

    - title: Why can't I apply for some of the licences in my Application Journey?
      content: |
        Some licences are required before you can apply for others. Based on this sequence, the Application Journey shows you the correct order in which to apply for them and tells you which licences you will need before applying for the next one.
