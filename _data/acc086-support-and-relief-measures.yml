  - title: What is the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS)?
    content: |
      The Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) provides wage support to employers, to help enterprises retain their local employees (Singaporean Citizens and Permanent Residents) during this period of economic uncertainty. Under the JSS, the Government co-funds a proportion of the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to each local employee.

      The level and duration of support each employer receives depends on the sector in which the employer operates. As JSS payouts are intended to offset and protect local employees' wages, employers who put local employees on mandatory no-pay leave (NPL) or retrench them will not be eligible for JSS payouts for those employees.

      Businesses that face cashflow challenges can continue to tap on the extended Temporary Bridging Loan Programme and enhanced Enterprise Financing Scheme, and we encourage businesses to make full use of these schemes.
