      Self-employed persons (SEPs) are required to contribute to their CPF MediSave Account, to ensure they have sufficient savings for their healthcare needs.

      If you are renewing a licence as a self-employed person, please note that licensing agencies will only process your licence renewal if you are up-to-date with your MediSave contributions - either paid in full or have an active GIRO arrangement with CPF Board.

      To check your MediSave payment status or make payment arrangements for any outstanding MediSave payable, please visit the Self-employment dashboard, which you can access via [cpf.gov.sg/MydashboardsFAQ](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/service/article/what-is-my-dashboards-and-what-is-available-in-my-dashboards) (Self-employment).

      Find out more about growing your CPF savings as a self-employed person at [cpf.gov.sg/selfemployedmatters](cpf.gov.sg/selfemployedmatters).
