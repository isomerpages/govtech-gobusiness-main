    - title: What is the Energy Efficiency Grant?
      content: |
        The Energy Efficiency Grant helps businesses transition towards being more energy efficient by co-funding investments in energy-efficient equipment. As announced at Budget 2024, the EEG will be expanded to more sectors from 1 April 2024. With the expanded EEG, information regarding EEG applications will be streamlined under one shopfront on GoBusiness, so that it is easier for businesses to access support for energy efficiency.

    - title: Which sectors are covered by the EEG?
      content: |
        As of 30 December 2024, eligible companies<sup>1</sup> in Construction, Food Services, Manufacturing (including Food Manufacturing), Maritime, Retail sectors and users of data centres will be able to tap on the EEG.

    - title: What is the Energy Efficiency Grant (Advanced)?
      content: |
        The Energy Efficiency Grant (EEG) (Advanced) helps businesses transition towards being more energy efficient through co-funding support for companies that wish to make larger investments to drive greater energy efficiency.

    - title: Why did the Government develop the EEG (Advanced)?
      content: |
        The EEG (Advanced) was designed in recognition that companies in certain sectors may need to invest more beyond the support provided in the EEG (Base) to purchase energy efficient equipment relevant to their operations.

    - title: What sectors does the EEG (Advanced) cover?
      content: |
        As of 30 December 2024, eligible companies in the Construction, Manufacturing (including Food Manufacturing) and Maritime sectors<sup>1</sup> can apply for the EEG (Advanced). 

        <sup>1</sup> Based on company's ACRA registered primary or secondary SSIC code.

    - title: What is the eligibility criteria for EEG (Advanced)?<sup>2</sup>
      content: |
        A company that meets all the following criteria can apply for the EEG (Advanced):
        
        - Business entity registered and operating in Singapore in the following sectors:
          - <b>Construction</b> companies that are classified under SSIC 41 - 43
          - <b>Manufacturing</b> companies that are classified under SSIC 10 to 32 (including Food Manufacturing)
          - <b>Maritime</b> companies which include:
            - <b>Port</b> Port companies classified under <b>SSIC 23940, 24109, 49231, 50021, 50023, 52101, 52221, 52222, 52224, 52243, 52292</b>

        - Co-operative societies and societies

        <sup>2</sup> Companies may be requested to furnish supporting documents as part of the grant application process.

        <sup>3</sup> For maritime companies, business entities need not have a minimum of 30% local shareholding criteria.

          - Group Employment Size of not more than 200 workers
        
    - title: What is the difference between the EEG (Base) and the EEG (Advanced)?
      content: |
        Unlike the EEG (Base), the EEG (Advanced) can support non-pre-approved equipment as long as the equipment demonstrates energy savings above 350 tonnes of lifetime carbon abatement. Support under the EEG (Advanced) is based on the lower of 
        
        (i) support levels under the EEG (Base) according to company's size<sup>6</sup>, or <br>
        (ii) based on the equipment's expected lifetime carbon abatement. Support will be capped at $350,000 across all of a company's EEG (Base) and EEG (Advanced) applications. 

        Companies applying for the EEG (Advanced) would also need to submit a third-party assessment report from a whitelisted third-party qualified assessor on the projected energy savings that the purchase of the energy efficient equipment would generate. This is not required for EEG (Base).

        <sup>6</sup> This will be 70% and 30% of energy efficient equipment costs for SMEs and non-SMEs respectively.

    - title: What equipment are currently not supported under EEG (Advanced)?
      content: | 
        Installation/Purchase of the following would not be supported under EEG (Advanced):<br>
          a)	Vehicles<br>
          b)	Key equipment in systems* that require Measurement & Verification at system level for legislation compliance or Green Mark Scheme (or equivalent government scheme)<br>
          c)	Blackbox solutions (i.e. software or hardware devices whose functioning cannot be explained by applying mainstream engineering knowledge and theories for EE improvements)<br>
          d)	Non-EE equipment, including monitoring devices and equipment that reduce carbon emission but does not reduce energy consumption (e.g. solar PV Panel, wind turbine)<br>
          e)	International vessels<br>

          <sup>*</sup> For chilled water system that do not need to comply with NEA's Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES), replacement of standalone key equipment of chilled water plant (e.g. chiller, cooling towers) can be supported under EEG(Advanced).<br>

          For chilled water system that shall comply with NEA's MEES, EEG (Advanced) can support chilled water system replacement/new installation that<br>

          (1a) can meet or exceed MEES performance standard <b>before</b> MEES comes into effect, or<br>
          (1b) exceed MEES performance standard <b>after</b> MEES comes into effect, whichever applies at the point of the first EEG(Advanced) submission; and<br>
          (2) is installed with M&V sensors/meters to facilitate post retrofit system efficiency determination for compliance with MEES. The cost of M&V sensors/meters would not be funded under EEG(Advanced).

          Applicant shall refer to the <a href='/images/eeg/EEG Advanced Third-party assessment report (July 2024).docx' target="_blank" rel="noopener">third-party assessment form</a> for details.
