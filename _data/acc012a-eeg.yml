    - title: What is the Energy Efficiency Grant?
      content: |
        The Energy Efficiency Grant helps businesses transition towards being more energy efficient by co-funding investments in energy-efficient equipment. As announced at Budget 2024, the EEG has been expanded to more sectors.

        Eligible companies in the Construction, Food Services, Manufacturing (including Food Manufacturing), Maritime, Retail sectors and users of data centres can tap on the EEG.<sup>1</sup>

        <sup>1</sup> <small>Based on company's ACRA registered primary or secondary SSIC code.</small>

    - title: What is the difference between the EEG (Base) and EEG (Advanced)?
      content: |
        <strong><u>For EEG (Base)</u></strong><br>
        The EEG (Base) supports companies to purchase pre-approved energy efficient equipment relevant to their companies.
        
        <strong><u>For EEG (Advanced)</u></strong><br>
        The EEG (Advanced) supports companies in the Construction, Manufacturing and Maritime sectors to adopt energy efficient equipment that is able to demonstrate energy savings above 350 tonnes of lifetime carbon abatement.
        
        Support under the EEG (Advanced) is based on the lower of (i) support levels under the EEG (Base) according to the company's size,<sup>2</sup> or (ii) based on the equipment's expected lifetime carbon abatement. Support is capped at S$350,000 across all EEG (Base) and EEG (Advanced) applications by the company.
        
        <sup>2</sup> <small>70% and 30% support of energy efficient equipment costs for SMEs and non-SMEs respectively.</small>

    - title: What is the duration and timeline for the EEG?
      content: |
        The grant application window for the EEG (Base) and EEG (Advanced) is from 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2026.

        Companies will have up to one year from the time an application is approved to purchase and install the equipment,<sup>3</sup> and submit claims for reimbursement. Once an application has been submitted, companies may choose to proceed to purchase and/or install the equipment before the application outcome.

        The company must not have made payment/deposits to a vendor prior to application submission.

        <sup>3</sup> <small>Only the actual purchase of the equipment is supportable. This excludes other related administrative fees/charges, e.g. delivery fees, installation.</small>
