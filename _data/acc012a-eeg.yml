    - title: What is the Energy Efficiency Grant (Advanced)?
      content: |
        The Energy Efficiency Grant (EEG) (Advanced) helps businesses transition towards being more energy efficient through co-funding support for companies that wish to make larger investments to drive greater energy efficiency.

    - title: Why did the Government develop the EEG (Advanced)?
      content: |
        The EEG (Advanced) was designed in recognition that companies in certain sectors may need to invest more beyond the support provided in the EEG (Base) to purchase energy efficient equipment relevant to their operations.

    - title: What sectors does the EEG (Advanced) cover?
      content: |
        From 1 April 2024, companies in the Manufacturing sector<sup>3</sup> can apply for the EEG (Advanced). We will further expand EEG (Advanced) to cover the maritime, construction and data centres sectors. More information will be available in due course.

        <sup>3</sup> Based on company’s ACRA registered SSIC code.

    - title: What is the eligibility criteria for EEG (Advanced)?
      content: |
        From 1 April 2024, A company that meets all the following criteria can apply for the EEG (Advanced):
        
        - Business entity registered and operating in Singapore in the Manufacturing sector as defined below
          - <b>Manufacturing</b> companies that are classified under SSIC 10 to 32 (including Food Manufacturing)
        <br><br>

        - Employ at least one local employee at the firm-level;
        - Has a Group Annual Sales Turnover no more than S$500 million.

    - title: What is the difference between the EEG (Base) and the EEG (Advanced)?
      content: |
        Unlike the EEG (Base), the EEG (Advanced) can support non-pre-approved equipment as long as the equipment demonstrates energy savings above 350 tonnes of lifetime carbon abatement. Support under the EEG (Advanced) is based on the lower of 
        
        (i) support levels under the EEG (Base) according to company’s size<sup>4</sup>, or <br>
        (ii) based on the equipment’s expected lifetime carbon abatement. Support will be capped at $350,000 across all of a company’s EEG (Base) and EEG (Advanced) applications. 

        Companies applying for the EEG (Advanced) would also need to submit a third-party assessment report from a whitelisted third-party qualified assessor on the projected energy savings that the purchase of the energy efficient equipment would generate. This is not required for EEG (Base).

        <sup>4</sup> This will be 70% and 30% of energy efficient equipment costs for SMEs and non-SMEs respectively.

    - title: How is the grant support for the EEG (Advanced) calculated?
      content: |
        Please refer to the following [link](https://www.checkfirst.gov.sg/c/551d6762-93f3-466c-a1be-418ef7f8d2f1){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to calculate the estimated grant support level for EEG (Advanced) based on the company’s size and equipment purchased.

    - title: What information needs to be included as part of the third-party assessment?
      content: |
        Please refer to the following <a href='/images/eeg/EEG Advanced FAQ (24.03.28)_vf.docx' target="_blank" rel="noopener">NEA | ESCO Accreditation</a></td> for the form that the whitelisted third-party qualified assessor would use to document the assessment and endorse the projected energy savings for the project. The signed form shall be submitted along with the application for the grant.
