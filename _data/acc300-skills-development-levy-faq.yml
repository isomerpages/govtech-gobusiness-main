      content: |
        The Skills Development Levy (SDL) is a levy used to support workforce upgrading programmes and to provide training grants to employers when they send their employees to attend training under the national Continuing Education and Training system.

        The SDL is administered by the SkillsFuture Singapore Agency (SSG).

    - title: How much do I have to contribute for the SDL?
      content: |
        The SDL payable is at 0.25% of the monthly total wages for each employee, with the minimum payable of $2 (for an employee earning less than $800 a month) and a maximum of $11.25 (for an employee earning more than $4,500 a month).

        <sup>*</sup>  Prior to 1 October 2008, an employer does not have to contribute SDL for employees whose monthly total wages is above the salary ceiling. However, with effect from 1 October 2008, an employer will have to contribute SDL even if the monthly total wages exceeds the salary ceiling. This is because the revised SDL regulations stipulate that the contribution is up to the first $4,500 of monthly total wages.

        <p><sup>#</sup> The legal requirement for SDL contributions by employers was introduced via gazette in Oct 1979. For employers who need to know the rates earlier than 1 July 2000, they may contact SSG for direct assistance.</p>

        The Government will review the levy rate regularly and any revision will take into account the need to maintain workforce and industry competitiveness through continuous skills upgrading and development.

        - An employee who is a domestic servant, chauffeur or gardener wholly and exclusively employed by an individual outside of that individual's trade, business, profession or vocation. 
        - An employee who does not render any services in Singapore for at least a month. This excludes employees who are on leave for that month.
        
        For more details, you can refer to the question on exemptions below.

    - title: Are ministries and statutory boards required to pay SDL for their employees?
      content: |
        Yes, ministries and statutory boards are still required to contribute SDL for their employees.

    - title: Do employers need to pay SDL for employees who are paid locally but work outside of Singapore?
      content: |
        No, employers do not need to pay SDL for employees who render services outside of Singapore. 

    - title: Do employers need to pay SDL for foreign employees?
      content: |
        Yes, employers need to pay SDL for foreign employees. This is in addition to any foreign employee levy payable to the Ministry of Manpower.

    - title: Why do I have to pay both SDL and Foreign Worker Levy (FWL) for foreign employees?
      content: |
        Both the SDL and FWL serve different purposes.

        SDL contributions are channelled to the Skills Development Fund which is used to build a national Continuing Education and Training (CET) system and provide financial assistance for employers to send their employees for training under the national CET system. Your foreign workers can benefit from the improvement of training facilities as well as the wide variety of courses available as SSG had used the moneys of the fund to improve the whole training ecosystem in Singapore.

        FWL is a levy imposed via the Ministry of Manpower for the administration of foreign workers with work permits.
        
    - title: If an employer engages a third party agent to pay wages on its behalf to its (the employer's) employees, does the employer still have to pay SDL?
      content: |
        Yes. For example, Company A has five employees and is liable to pay wages to those employees. Company A engages a third party agent, Company B, to pay wages to the five employees on its (Company A's) behalf. There is no contractual relationship between Company B and the employees.

        In the above scenario, Company A is still required to pay SDL for the five employees, notwithstanding that the wages is paid by Company B on its behalf.

    - title: Which categories of employees or workers are exempted from SDL?
      content: |
        SDL is not required for:
          - An employee who is a domestic servant, chauffeur or gardener wholly and exclusively employed by an individual outside of that individual's trade, business, profession or vocation.

    - title: Can employers be exempted from paying SDL if they are not tapping on SDF training assistance?
      content: |
        No. The collection of SDL and the disbursement of SDF training assistance are separate matters.

        SDF training assistance is given as financial incentives for employers to upgrade their workers' skills. The SDL payment by an employer is not tied to the amount of funding the employer can obtain from SDF to train its workers. For details on SDF funding, please visit the SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) website.
    
    - title: If there's a change in the shareholders of a company, or a change in the partners of a limited liability partnership (LLP), is the company or LLP required to pay the outstanding SDL?

    - title: How do employers calculate SDL for months with bonus pay-outs or allowances?
      content: |
        For a month where the employee is paid bonus or allowance, the amount of bonus or allowance is considered as wages for that month.

        For example, if the employee's salary for December is $3,000 and the bonus paid in December is $1,000, SDL should be calculated based on $4,000 ($3,000 +$1,000). SDL payable is $10 ($4,000 x 0.25%).
    
    - title: How do I calculate SDL for employees who work in Singapore but whose wages are paid in foreign currencies?
      content: |
        If wages are paid in a foreign currency, the employer should calculate the amount of SDL payable, based on the equivalent value in Singapore dollars.
 
        The wage can be converted to Singapore dollars using any of the published exchange rates used by a major local bank.

    - title: How do I calculate SDL for employees who are on paid leave or no-pay leave?
      content: |
        If the employer pay wages to the employee during the period of leave, the amount of SDL payable can be calculated based on that wage.

    - title: How do I make payment for the monthly SDL?
      content: |
        Employers can pay monthly SDL via CPF EZPay or GoBusiness.

        - CPF EZPay. You will be able to use the SDL auto computation feature to compute your employee's SDL payable based on the wage information for all Singapore Citizen and Singapore Permanent Resident employees. You will need to input the SDL payable for foreign employees in CPF EZPay. You will only be able to make payment for 1 month per transaction. For more details, please refer to Section - Auto-computation of Skills Development Levy (SDL) via CPF EZPay.
        
        Payment made via CPF Board takes approximately two months for the transaction to be reflected in SSG's records.

        Employers making back-payments or with only foreign employees can make payment through SDL payment service on GoBusiness.

        Payment made via the GoBusiness will take up to two weeks to be reflected in SSG's records.

        If you have received a Notice of Assessment (NOA) or mailer from SSG, do make payments for SDL via GoBusiness by selecting the Relevant Month(s) for the period indicated in the NOA or mailer.
 
    - title: What should I do if I have forgotten to pay, or have been underpaying SDL?
      content: |

        Please ensure to select the Relevant Month(s) for backpayment.

        If you have received a Notice of Assessment (NOA) or mailer from SSG, do make payments for SDL via GoBusiness by selecting the period (for example: start date as 01/01/2023 and end date as 31/12/2023) indicated in the NOA or mailer.
        
    - title: What happens if I do not pay SDL on time?
      content: |
        The Skills Development Levy Regulations made under the Skills Development Levy Act 1979 provides for the imposition of a late payment penalty at the rate of 10% per annum of the amount outstanding. Your organisation's eligibility for SkillsFuture Singapore Agency's funding support may also be affected.

    - title: What SDL-related documents do I need to prepare and keep?
      content: |
        Employers will need to prepare and keep a register containing the following details for every employee:
        - Employee's full name, gender, age, address, identity card number, nature of employment, rate and amount of wage, date of commencement and cessation of employment, and such other records for SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) to ascertain the levy payable.

        SSG may also request for records such as the CPF Board's Record of Payment (Form 90/90A) as documentary evidence of SDL payment.

    - title: What are the penalties for giving false information regarding the employer's liability to pay SDL?
      content: |

    - title: What is the auto-computation of SDL feature on CPF EZPay?
      content: |
        Employers who contribute SDL via CPF EZPay, can get their SDL payable automatically calculated for their local employees in the relevant month based on their declared wage.
 
        <img src='/images/sdl-Auto-Computation-1.png' aria-hidden='true'>
          
        For foreign employees, employers can use SSG's SDL online calculator to work out the actual SDL contribution and indicate the lump sum payment under the "Skills Development Levy (SDL) - For foreign employees" section in the same transaction.

        <img src='/images/sdl-Auto-Computation-2.png' aria-hidden='true'>

    - title: Do I need to round off the SDL amount to be paid for the foreign employees?
      content: |
        No, you should indicate the actual amount payable under the "Skills Development Levy (SDL) – For foreign employees" field when submitting the details. CPF EZPay will sum up the total SDL amount payable (for both your local and foreign employees) and the final amount will be rounded down to the nearest dollar at the confirmation and payment page.

    - title: How do employers calculate SDL for months with bonus pay-outs or allowances?
      content: |
        The bonus pay-outs or allowances should be added to the monthly salary and employers should use the total sum to determine the SDL for their employees. For example, if the employee's salary for Dec 2023 is $3,000 and the bonus paid in Dec 2023 is $1,000, SDL should be calculated based on $4,000 ($3,000 +$1,000). In this scenario, SDL payable is $10 ($4,000 x 0.25%).

    - title: What should I do if I do not want the system to auto-compute the SDL amount?
      content: |
        We strongly encourage the use of the auto-computation feature which improves your convenience in making SDL contributions.
        
        To disable the auto-computation during the online submission, employers can edit the "SDL To be Paid" field or set the SDL payable option to "No" for certain employees who do not require SDL contributions.
        
        Thereafter, please submit a declaration of your computed monthly SDL payable excluding these exempted employees for the relevant months via GoBusiness.
        
        Please retain all supporting documents as per your declaration as SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) may request for them subsequently.
