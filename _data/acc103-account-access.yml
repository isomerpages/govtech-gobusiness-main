        - trading under your NRIC registered name
        - trading under an entity without a registered UEN
        - applying for a Corppass Admin account

        Log in as a Business User if you are trading on behalf of a UEN-registered company.

        To log in as a Business User, your company's Corppass Administrator or Sub-Administrator will need to assign your digital service access to GoBusiness. You can find out how to do that on the [Corppass website](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/cpauth/login/homepage?URL=%2F&TAM_OP=login){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

        Please note that from 11 April 2021, you will be required to log in to government digital services for businesses using Singpass instead of Corppass. For more information,  visit [go.gov.sg/corporate-login](http://go.gov.sg/corporate-login){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
