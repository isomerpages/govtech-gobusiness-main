    content: The equipment (autonomous or one man operated) has the capability to facilitate the collection of waste from point to point. Examples of such capability include bin-lifting, towing, pulling, transporting etc.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution35' target='_blank'>Battery operated waste collection equipment</a><br/><br/><br/>Machine equipped with cutting or shearing or crushing system(s) to reduce the volume of solid waste/recyclables.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution60' target='_blank'>Industrial crusher/shredder</a><br/><br/><br/>The system is designed to lift and wash the waste bins automatically with only one man needed to operate the system.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution74' target='_blank'>Mobile/static refuse bin washing system</a><br/><br/><br/>The food waste recycling system with the provision of the in-feed station is able to convert recycle food waste into organic fertilisers/ compost/ discharge in liquid form. It will reduce the needs for separation, transportation and collection of these food waste for disposal.*All systems are required to be implemented in compliance with all prevailing local regulations.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution82' target='_blank'>On-site food waste recycling system</a><br/><br/><br/>A plastic washing line is used to wash and convert dirty plastic materials into dry clean plastics suitable for recycling.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution85' target='_blank'>Plastics washing system</a><br/><br/><br/>The side loader system, which comprises of a side loading compactor body mounted onto a vehicle chassis and the use of compatible collection bins, allows the driver to remotely operate the collection process in the cabin. The collection vehicle must be fitted with an on board camera system for ease of visibility of remote side loading operation and safety, a tonnage monitoring system for the tracking of tonnage of waste/recyclables collected in each premises.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution122' target='_blank'>Side-loader waste collection system</a><br/><br/><br/>The equipment using sensors to detect and compacts materials automatically to facilitate the transportation of the materials.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution123' target='_blank'>Smart Baler System</a><br/><br/><br/>The equipment should allow Users to monitor bin fill levels with multiple fill level settings, send notifications to collectors when bins are reaching capacity and preferably with software to allow Users to gather data for trend analytics.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution124' target='_blank'>Smart litter bin with compactor function</a><br/><br/><br/>Waste-handling system integrated with smart features to enable on-demand waste collection. The equipment must minimally be equipped with sensors such as fill-level or weight monitoring system which allows operators and premises owners to monitor and react to its usage, efficiency and fill level to enable on-demand waste collection.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution125' target='_blank'>Smart mobile/static compactors</a><br/><br/><br/>The Smart Waste Oil Collection System, which is equipped with diagnostics, fill-level sensors and data management system, transports waste oil from the fryer to the waste oil containment tank with minimal human intervention.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution128' target='_blank'>Smart Waste Oil Collection System</a><br/><br/><br/>The plastics waste recycling system with the provision of automated sorting, friction cleaning, and extrusion technology is able to process polymer streams  (i.e. PET, LDPE , HDPE  or PP ) into high quality recycled plastic compounds such as processed pellets or flakes.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution186' target='_blank'>Plastic Recycling System</a><br/><br/><br/>Forklift with load capacity from 1.5 ton to 10 ton, that is able to lift, move and/or stack materials, with only one operator.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution278' target='_blank'>Engine/Electric- powered forklift</a><br/><br/><br/>Pallet with load capacity ranging from 1.2 ton to 2.5 ton, that is able to transport or stack the pallets, with only one operator.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution279' target='_blank'>Electric pallet transporter/stacker</a><br/><br/><br/>Reach truck with load capacity ranging from 1.2 ton to 2.5 ton, that is able to reach loads located high up in racks, with only one operator.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution280' target='_blank'>Electric reach truck</a><br/>
