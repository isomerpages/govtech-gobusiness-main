      The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Workforce Singapore (WSG), in collaboration with the Public Service Division (PSD) and various government agencies, launched the SGUnited Jobs Initiative and SGUnited Traineeships Programme to create jobs.

      This was part of the Resilience Budget to create more opportunities for jobseekers and workers affected by the COVID-19 situation, as well as match them to available jobs, including new ones created as a result of COVID-19. The initiative also aims to help businesses that are recruiting for the eventual recovery, as well as those with short-term manpower needs due to disruptions in labour supply.

      Whether you are looking to tackle the ongoing economic challenges, attract and retain local manpower, or improve productivity and innovation, WSG has the following programmes to provide you with support and resources customised for your manpower needs.
