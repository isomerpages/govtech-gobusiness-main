  - title: My firm is not permitted to operate but I have a shipment of goods coming in. Will I be allowed to send the goods to my work premise and will I be able to activate my employees to receive the shipment at my work premise?

      Port operators and logistics service providers will be allowed to continue to operate during this period. Yes, you may receive deliveries at your premises. If you need to activate your employees to work on-site for short periods of time to receive deliveries and perform other related tasks, please apply for a time-limited exemption. Please submit your application **one day before** the required date of use.
