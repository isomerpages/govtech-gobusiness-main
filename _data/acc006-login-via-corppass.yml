      You need a [Corppass account](https://www.Corppass.gov.sg/cpauth/login/homepage?TAM_OP=login){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to access Business Grants Portal. If your business doesn't have a Corppass administrator, [find out how](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/corppass/common/findoutmore){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}to appoint one.

      If you have a Corppass administrator, get them to create an account for you and assign an appropriate BGP e-Service role, so you can access the Portal.

      <p style="color:blue;">From 4 Nov 2024, BGP's Corppass e-service will be renamed from "BGP" to "ApplyGov". This is an e-Service name change on Corppass and does not affect existing roles and access to BGP. For new BGP users, simply add the appropriate roles under "ApplyGov" e-Service.</p>
