    - title: What is Harmonised System (HS) Code and HS Classification?
      content: |
        The Harmonised System (HS) codes of goods is an international nomenclature developed by World Customs Organisation (WCO) for classification of goods across borders which is harmonized at the 6 digit-level (e.g. 2203.00). In ASEAN countries (e.g. Singapore), the HS codes of goods is harmonized at the 8-digit level (2203.00.11).

        HS Classification is the process of finding the most specific description in the HS to classify your product.

    - title: What is Competent Authorities (CA) Product Code and what should i look out for if my product is controlled?
      content: |
        If the goods are subject to control by the relevant Competent Authority, you are required to comply with the respective CA's requirement when preparing and completing a permit application for submission via TradeNet. This may include having a CA product code for such controlled goods.

        The Competent Authorities (CA) Product Code are product codes assigned by CAs for controlled goods or goods subjected to restrictions in Singapore. You are advised to check if your item is controlled by any CAs before it is imported into, or transhipped via, or exported from Singapore. You may enter a description of the product, HS code or CA product code in the HS/CA Product Code
        Checker. If the product is subjected to control, the name of the CA(s) and the relevant licence information will be displayed in the search results. You may wish to liaise directly with the CA(s) and check if the product code is required to be declared in the permit application.
