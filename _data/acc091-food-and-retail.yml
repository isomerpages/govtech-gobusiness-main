    - title: Am I allowed to operate at full capacity during this time?  Or must we limit work to specific hours or at certain manpower limits?
      content: |
        From 29 March 2022, more employees<sup>1</sup> are allowed to return to the workplace.

        i. Up to 75% of employees who are able to work from home can be at the workplace at any point in time. For example, a company with 100 employees who can work from home can have up to 75 of these employees at the workplace at any point in time.

        ii. Those who report to work onsite are encouraged to self-test weekly via an Antigen Rapid Test (ART).

        iii. As workplace requirements and business models vary, employers are best placed to decide on work arrangements to ensure operational effectiveness and sustainability in the long run.

        Only employees who are fully vaccinated, certified to be medically ineligible or have recovered from COVID-19 within 180 days, can return to the workplace. Unvaccinated persons are no longer able to take a negative Pre-Event Test (PET) to enter VDS settings such as the workplace. 

        Employers and employees can refer to the [Updated Advisory on COVID-19 Vaccination at the Workplace](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-employment-settings){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more details on work arrangements for unvaccinated employees. 

        Special attention should be paid to vulnerable employees (e.g. older workers, pregnant workers, and those with underlying medical conditions) to enable them to work from home. For these employees, you could consider temporarily redeploying them to another role within the company so that they are able to telecommute or work from home.

        <sup>1</sup> Interns, part-time staff, etc. who are under a contract of service are also employees

    - title: Can F&B establishments allow dine-in?
      content: |
        F&B establishments are allowed to conduct food service operations, with the exception of establishments with Pubs, Bars, Nightclubs, Discos and Karaoke SFA license categories or SSIC codes starting with 5613. 

        Groups of up to 10 fully vaccinated persons will be allowed to dine-in at F&B establishments, including hawker centres and coffee shops, where full Vaccination-Differentiated SMMs (VDS) checks have been implemented at the entrances. 

        To ease the operational burden, F&B establishments do not need to conduct full VDS checks at entrances should they choose to only offer dine-in for groups of up to 5 fully vaccinated persons. Random spot checks will be done to ensure that only vaccinated persons are dining-in at these places, and the onus will be on the dining-in individuals to abide by the rules.

        Customers can only dine in if they meet any of the following criteria:

        a.	Are fully vaccinated<sup>2</sup>; 

        b.	Have recovered from COVID-19<sup>3</sup>; or

        c.	Are unvaccinated children aged 12 years and below (i.e. born in or after 2010<sup>4</sup>); or

        d.	Are certified to be medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme
        
          * Medically ineligible individuals will need to show the 'vaccination exemption' status via the Trace-Together App/Token, HealthHub or present a hard copy memo<sup>5</sup> issued by a General Practitioner (GP) clinic, public or private healthcare institution, along with a government-issued photo identification card for entry into these premises. More details on the criteria for medical ineligibility can be found in the sample of the standard memo [here](https://go.gov.sg/acceptabledocs){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

        F&B establishments have the right to deny entry for customers who do not meet the VDS requirements. Refer to [MOH's information sheet for more details of the requirements for VDS](https://go.gov.sg/vdsmminfo){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

        <sup>2</sup> This means they must have received the appropriate regimen of [World Health Organisation Emergency Use Listing](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} (WHO EUL) vaccines. For more information, refer to [MOH’s information sheet on the requirements for VDS](https://go.gov.sg/vdsmminfo){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.<br>
        <sup>3</sup> From 1 January 2022, all recovered persons from COVID-19 who are not fully vaccinated will only be given a 180-day exemption after infection to enter the F&B establishment for dine in. Those who have recovered from COVID-19 and have exceeded the 180-day period, but have yet to be fully vaccinated, are given until 31 January 2022 to complete their primary vaccination regime, so as to be able to enter VDS settings.<br>

        b. Events with > 1,000 persons will be subjected to a capacity limit of 75%<sup>17</sup>.

        For mask-off events, capacity limits will be determined by the size of the venue as long as individuals comply with the prevailing group size and safe distancing of at least one metre between groups. 
        
        a. Outdoor mask-off events will be subject to the same SMMs as all other mask-off events. Event organisers are recommended to impose the wearing of masks at outdoor events due to the possible crowds at such events.

    - title: Can I allow a foreign customer who received his/her PSAR-approved vaccines overseas and provides proof of this vaccination to dine in my F&B establishment/ partake in personal care services provided at my shop?
      content: |
        Hard-copy and digital overseas vaccination certs are not recognised. 

        <b>All individuals aged 12 years and above</b> who have been fully vaccinated overseas with any vaccines approved under the WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) needs to get their overseas vaccination records ingested into the National Immunisation Registry (NIR). This includes Singaporean Citizens (SC), Singapore Permanent Residents (PR), Long-Term Pass Holder (LTPH) (e.g. Long-Term Visitor Pass, Work Permit, Employment Pass, S Pass, Dependent Pass, Student Pass) and Short-Term Pass Holders (STPH). For STPHs, this would only be relevant to those who intend to stay in Singapore for more than 30 days. You may call ahead to any clinic to check if they provide such services. You can also refer to [phpc.gov.sg](https://my-sgdcs.sgnet.gov.sg/personal/ESG-CY6678/Documents/phpc.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for a listing of clinics who may provide such services; please call ahead to check. The full cost of the service will be borne by the individual.

        If their overseas vaccination documents are not in English, they will need to get the documents translated by a translation service provider, notary public or embassy of the country that issued the document. Both the original overseas vaccination document and translated document must be brought along when visiting a private healthcare provider in Singapore for serology testing.

        After arriving in Singapore, the individual will need to visit a healthcare provider who will do the following:

        2. Perform a serology test.
        
        3. Update the individual's overseas COVID-19 vaccination record(s) to NIR as long as the individual (i) has overseas COVID-19 vaccination documentation, and (ii) whose serology test result is positive.
        
        4. Individuals will see their vaccinations status on TraceTogether or HealthHub app within 24 hours after clinic has notified NIR of their overseas COVID-19 vaccination records.

    - title: Why are overseas vaccination certificates not recognised for VDS?
      content: |
        Overseas vaccine certificates (hard or softcopy) will not be accepted for VDS because it is difficult for individual establishments to verify the authenticity of these certificates which are issued in different formats and languages.

        All travellers, including those on VTL, will be required to download the TraceTogether app or rent a TraceTogether token during their stay in Singapore.

        Travellers who are vaccinated overseas would get their overseas vaccinated records reflected electronically on TraceTogether to show, on demand, to be eligible for VDS. Travellers would be granted temporary vaccinated status lasting 30 days or 180 days (only for travellers who uploaded their QR codes while applying for the VTP). This can be done through: 
        
        * Uploading their digitally-verifiable vaccination certificate in their SG Arrival Card; or 
        
        * Presenting their vaccination certificate to the ICA officer at manual immigration clearance. 

        To maintain the vaccination status beyond the temporary status, they will need to take a serology test at the following clinics (go.gov.sg/clinicsforserology) to have their vaccination records ingested into the National Immunisation Registry (NIR). Following this, their vaccination status will be reflected in the TraceTogether app or token within 24 hours.

        For information on vaccinated status for travel to Singapore, please refer to

    - title: Are there concessions for individuals who are medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines?
      content: |
        Those who are medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme are eligible for VDS. 

        They will need to show the 'vaccination exemption' status via the Trace-Together App/Token, HealthHub or present a hard copy memo<sup>19</sup> issued by a General Practitioner (GP) clinic, public or private healthcare institution, along with a government-issued photo identification card for entry into these premises. More details on the criteria for medical ineligibility can be found in the sample of the standard memo [here](https://go.gov.sg/acceptabledocs){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

        <sup>19</sup> To be certified as medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme, individuals may visit a doctor familiar with their medical condition, or alternatively, any clinic or hospital to obtain a hardcopy doctor-certified memo.

    - title: Can my unvaccinated workers enter the workplace with a PET done?
      content: |
        Workers who are not fully vaccinated cannot enter the workplace. These would include all third-party vendors who visit the F&B establishment, including food delivery personnel.

        Only workers who are fully vaccinated, have recovered from COVID-19 within the past 180 days or are medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme can continue to enter the workplace.

    - title: Should F&B/spa/gym staff who are unvaccinated be redeployed to other roles? How is the government protecting the jobs of unvaccinated staff affected by this policy ('vaccinate or regular test') and prevent employers from displacing/letting them go?
      content: |
        The pre-event testing (PET) concession for unvaccinated persons to go to work under the Workforce Vaccination Measures has been removed. 

        Workers who are fully vaccinated, have recovered from COVID-19 within the past 180 days or are medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme can continue to enter the workplace. 

        For unvaccinated employees whose work can be performed at home, employers may allow them to continue to work from home. For those whose work cannot be performed from home, employers can explore redeploying them to suitable jobs which can be done from home if such jobs are available, with renumeration commensurate with the responsibilities of the alternative jobs. 

        Please refer to [MOM's Requirements for Safe Management Measures at the Workplace](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more details.  

    - title: Can I ask my employees to declare their vaccination status to me?
      content: |
        Employers may ask employees for their vaccination status for business purposes e.g. business continuity planning. While employers may adopt differentiated workplace measures for vaccinated and unvaccinated employees, they should not terminate or threaten to terminate the service of unvaccinated employees on the basis of their vaccination status alone.

    - title: What kind of activations are allowed in mall atriums and common areas?
      content: |
        Activities and events can be held at public and common areas such as mall atriums, public transport nodes, HDB estates and common corridors, subject to capacity limits stated below and any further restrictions imposed by the premises owner. 

        Capacity limits for mask-on events are as follows:

        a. Events with ≤ 1,000 persons will not be subjected to any capacity limit.

        b. Events with > 1,000 persons will be subjected to a capacity limit of 75%<sup>20</sup>.

        For mask-off events, capacity limits will be determined by the size of the venue as long as individuals comply with the prevailing group size and safe distancing of at least one metre between groups. 

        Vaccination-Differentiated SMMs (VDS) must be implemented for all events. This also applies to events held at retail and lifestyle-related services establishments, unless they are located within premises that already require VDS upon entry. 

        <sup>20</sup> For example, for a 1,200 pax event, the event would need to be held at a venue which accommodates 1,600 pax, or the event size would have to be capped at 1,000 pax. Events where one-metre safe distancing and group size limits apply will not be subject to the 75% capacity limit, as these SMMs already ensure spreading out of attendees.
