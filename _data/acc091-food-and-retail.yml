        Please refer to the Safe Management Measures and guidelines stipulated in the sector-specific advisories on the GoBusiness portal.

    - title: Am I allowed to operate at full capacity during this time?  Or must we limit work to specific hours or at certain manpower limits?
      content: |
        From 1 January 2022, more employees<sup>1</sup> are allowed to return to the workplace.

        i. Up to 50% of employees who are able to work from home can be at the workplace at any point in time. For example, a company with 100 employees who can work from home can have up to 50 of these employees at the workplace at any point in time.

        ii. Those who report to work onsite are encouraged to self-test weekly via an Antigen Rapid Test (ART).

        iii. As workplace requirements and business models vary, employers are best placed to decide on work arrangements to ensure operational effectiveness and sustainability in the long run. 

        Only employees who are fully vaccinated, certified to be medically ineligible or have recovered from COVID-19 within 180 days, can return to the workplace. Unvaccinated persons are no longer able to take a negative Pre-Event Test (PET) to enter VDS settings such as the workplace. 

        Employers and employees can refer to the [Updated Advisory on COVID-19 Vaccination at the Workplace](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-employment-settings){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more details on work arrangements for unvaccinated employees. 

        Special attention should be paid to vulnerable employees (e.g. older workers, pregnant workers, and those with underlying medical conditions) to enable them to work from home. For these employees, you could consider temporarily redeploying them to another role within the company so that they are able to telecommute or work from home.

        <sup>1</sup> Interns, part-time staff, etc. who are under a contract of service are also employees

    - title: Do I need to send my staff for regular testing under the FET regime?
      content: |
        From 18 February 2022, F&B establishments, malls, large standalone stores and supermarket outlets, as well as those in personal care services (e.g. facial and nail services, spas/saunas, massage establishments, hairdressing, and make-up services) will no longer be required to conduct Fast and Easy Test Rostered Routine Testing, or FET RRT. This is a change from the current practice where all workers in these establishments are to be tested once every 7 days under FET RRT, regardless of vaccination status.

        Companies that have remaining kits that were already distributed to them for RRT are strongly encouraged to continue testing until the test kits are fully utilised. There is no need for companies to submit these test results onto Swab Registration System

    - title: Can F&B establishments allow dine-in?
      content: |
        F&B establishments are allowed to conduct food service operations, with the exception of establishments with Pubs, Bars, Nightclubs, Discos and Karaoke SFA license categories or SSIC codes starting with 5613. VDS continues to apply to all F&B establishments that provide dine-in services.

        Up to 5 persons are allowed to dine in together at F&B establishments, as long as they have met requirements for VDS. Unvaccinated children aged 12 years and below (i.e. born in or after 2010) may be included within the group of 5 persons as long as all the children are from the same household. From 1 March 2022, those born in 2009 who turn 13 in 2022 will need to be fully vaccinated to dine in.

        Groups of up to 5 persons are allowed to dine in at hawker centres and coffee shops<sup>2</sup> where full VDS checks have been implemented<sup>3</sup>. Otherwise, dining-in at hawker centres and coffee shops without full VDS checks will remain at groups of up to 2 persons who are fully vaccinated. Strict enforcement action will be taken against coffeeshops that allow groups of up to 5 fully vaccinated persons to dine in without implementing the necessary checks as well as against individuals who breach this rule. 

        Customers can only dine in if they meet any of the following criteria:

        a.	Are fully vaccinated<sup>4</sup>; 

        b.	Have recovered from COVID-19<sup>5</sup>; or

        c.	Are unvaccinated children aged 12 years and below (i.e. born in or after 2010<sup>6</sup>). If there are 2 or more such children in the group, the children must be from the same household.

        d.	Are certified to be medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme
        
          * Medically ineligible individuals will need to show the 'vaccination exemption' status via the Trace-Together App/Token, HealthHub or present a hard copy memo issued by a General Practitioner (GP) clinic, public or private healthcare institution, along with a government-issued photo identification card for entry into these premises. More details on the criteria for medical ineligibility can be found in the sample of the standard memo here.

        F&B establishments (including those in malls) must verify the vaccination status of customers. Dine-in is not allowed if any individual does not meet the eligibility criteria above. Allowing this would be an offence.

        <sup>2</sup> Coffee shops refer generally to F&B establishments with SFA coffee shop/ eating house/ canteen license <u>that are not substantially enclosed by a permanent barrier</u>.<br>
        <sup>3</sup> Area-bound VDS and/or time-bound VDS can be implemented to accommodate dine-in groups of up to 5 fully vaccinated persons once approved by SFA . Refer to the requirements outlined in [Guidelines on Vaccinated-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) for coffee shop and canteen operators](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/covid-19/guidelines-on-vaccination-differentiated-safe-management-measures-(vds)-for-coffee-shop-and-canteen-operators){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.<br>
        <sup>4</sup> This means they must have received the appropriate regimen of [W]orld Health Organisation Emergency Use Listing](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} (WHO EUL) vaccines. For more information, refer to [MOH’s information sheet on the requirements for VDS](https://go.gov.sg/vdsmminfo){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.<br>
        <sup>5</sup> From 1 January 2022, all recovered persons from COVID-19 who are not fully vaccinated will only be given a 180-day exemption after infection to enter the F&B establishment for dine in. Those who have recovered from COVID-19 and have exceeded the 180-day period, but have yet to be fully vaccinated, are given until 31 January 2022 to complete their primary vaccination regime, so as to be able to enter VDS settings.<br>
        <sup>6</sup> Children born in 2009 who turn 13 in 2022 will need to be fully vaccinated to enter venues and participate in activities with VDS from <b>1 March 2022</b>. 

    - title: For children, what kind of declaration is considered acceptable? Can parents verbally declare that their children live in the same address or do they need a written document to prove that? If a written document is required, what kind of document will that be?
      content: |
        For children under 15 who do not have a NRIC or SingPass, a verbal declaration by the family on the household status would be accepted. Individuals are reminded that strict enforcement action will be taken against anyone who pretends to be from the same household. 

    - title: Can a group of unvaccinated children dine together without an adult?
      content: |
        Children under 12 will be allowed to dine-in at F&B establishments. From 1 March 2022, those born in 2009 who turn 13 in 2022 will need to be fully vaccinated to dine in. However, if there are 2 or more of such unvaccinated children in the group, the children must be from the same household. Unvaccinated children do not need to be accompanied by an adult when dining in. 

    - title: For VDS, I understand that the children in the group must be from the same household. What about the other individuals in the group? Can we be from different households?
      content: |
        Yes, eligible individuals (13 years old and above) in the group can be from different households; they need not be from the same household as the children. Within the group, only unvaccinated children (12 and under) need to be from the same household. 

    - title: Must a food delivery personnel wear a mask at all times?
      content: |
        Food delivery personnel must wear a mask at all times in the course of their work.

    - title: Can work-related events continue to be held at F&B establishments?
      content: |
        F&B establishments may serve as venues for marriage events<sup>7</sup> and/or work-related events and are required to comply with the SMMs for these events. 

        Work-related events can be held within the workplace premises or third-party venues. Such events are not permitted at public and common areas such as mall atriums, public transport nodes, HDB estates and common corridors. Prevailing guidelines for the respective event venues will apply for work-related events (i.e., if the event is held within a F&B establishment, the F&B SMMs will apply for the event).

        VDS must also be implemented for all events, irrespective of event size and whether F&B is served. 

        a) <b>Non customer-facing events</b> (e.g. promotion/human resource event for workers):  
        
          * Meals should not be the main feature. Enterprises should avoid holding events over mealtimes. F&B should only be served if they are incidental to the event (e.g. the meeting or conference extends over lunchtime). F&B must be served in individual portions , and participants must be seated while consuming the F&B. Participants should put on their masks as soon as they have finished eating or drinking. 
          
          * All events where participants are not seated or standing in a fixed location, regardless of whether F&B is served/consumed, are subject to a cap of 50 persons.
        
          * If F&B is served/ consumed, such events are subject to a cap of 50 persons, depending on venue size and safe distancing requirements of at least one-metre distance between individuals. 
        
          * If there are no mask-off activities (e.g. no F&B served/consumed) and participants are seated or standing in a fixed location the event can have up to 1,000 persons, depending on venue size and safe distancing requirements of at least one-metre distance between individuals. 
        
            Please refer to MOM's [Requirements for Safe Management Measures at the Workplace](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more information on additional measures required (e.g. zoning).<br>
            Event organisers must [notify the relevant authorities](https://form.gov.sg/#!/61cb1588369b3a001342c27f){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} at least 5 days in advance before these larger events are held. Firm action will be taken against non-compliance with these SMMs, including the failure to notify. 

        b) <b>Customer-facing events</b> (e.g. product launches, outlet opening):

          * Meals should not be the main feature. Event organisers should avoid holding events over mealtimes. F&B should only be served if they are incidental to the event (e.g. product launch extends over lunchtime). F&B must be served in individual portions , and participants must be seated while consuming the food and drinks. There should be no intermingling between the groups. Participants should put on their masks as soon as they have finished eating or drinking. 
        
          * Events organised by F&B establishments within their own premises are subject to the maximum number of individuals that the venue may accommodate after safe distancing measures are adhered to.
          
          * Events organised by external parties (where the F&B premises now functions as a third-party venue) are subject to a cap of 50 persons (excluding the F&B establishment’s service workers), depending on venue size and safe distancing requirements.
        
          * Event participants can be in groups of up to 5 persons. There must be at least a one-metre distance between groups. 

        <sup>7</sup> Refer to the requirements on the [GoBusiness portal](/safemanagement/sector/) for the SMMs on Marriage Solemnisations and Wedding Receptions.<br>

        <sup>9</sup> Food served through staff-served food lines must also be served in individual portions.

    - title: Can F&B establishment allow in their premises social gatherings with more than 5 persons?
      content: |
        Social gatherings or interactions involving more than 5 persons are not allowed. 

        F&B establishments should not accept reservations or walk-ins, or allow in their premises social gatherings with more than 5 persons, even if they are split across multiple tables. Exceptions can only be made if all members of the group are from the same household, i.e. have the same place of residence (families living in different places of residence are not from the same household). However, they will need to be seated in separate groups/tables, with no more than 5 persons per group/table, with at least one-metre spacing maintained between these groups. F&B establishments are required to verify customers’ claims that they are from the same household, and can decline service at their discretion. 

        <b>There must be no intermingling between groups.</b>

    - title: Can I have a mascot or lion dance in my F&B establishment?
      content: |
        No. Mascots and lion dances are not allowed within the F&B establishment as they are considered live performances which are not permitted under F&B Safe Management Measures today.

    - title: Can my staff introduce dishes/drinks at the table?
      content: |
        Yes. Staff can introduce the dish/drink at the table where necessary, as part of usual restaurant operations. However, staff should minimise contact with diners and minimise the time they spend at each table.

    - title: Can I play card games in the F&B establishment?
      content: |
        F&B establishments can offer board games/card games. However, gambling and/or gaming instruments (e.g. dice, mahjong tiles, playing cards) are not permitted.

    - title: Can I use my self-service drink dispenser? 
      content: |
        Yes. Self-service drink dispensers can be used if there are no repeat visits to the dispenser.

    - title: Can I install dividers between booths within my F&B establishment to allow back-to-back seating?
      content: |
        No. Dividers/partitions cannot replace the 1m safe distancing requirement, even if it extends all the way to the ceiling. Establishments must maintain 1m distancing between back-to-back diners, even if there is a partition installed.

    - title: Can I stream a Zoom meeting in my F&B establishment?
      content: |
        If the meeting only involves internal parties (i.e. internal staff), the premise would be considered a workplace and hence measures outlined in [MOM's Requirements for Safe Management Measures (SMMs) at the Workplace](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} would apply. Under MOM's SMMs for workplaces, activities such as streaming and the use of screens etc., are permitted. 

        However, if there are external parties in the F&B establishment (i.e. a customer-facing event/premise is used as a third party event venue), then F&B SMMs would apply and all entertainment elements (including video streaming) are not permitted.

    - title: Can my F&B establishment be booked out for an event?
      content: |
        Yes. F&B establishments may serve as venues for marriage events<sup>10</sup> and/or work-related events<sup>11</sup> and are required to comply with the SMMs for these events.

        For work-related events, prevailing guidelines for the respective event venues will apply additionally. If the work-related event is held within a F&B establishment, the F&B SMMs will apply for the event. This means that entertainment components e.g. emcee or speech in an award ceremony and all forms of film/video/TV screenings are therefore disallowed.

        Social events, e.g. DnD and gala dinners, are not allowed to be organised. 

        <sup>10</sup> Refer to the requirements on the [GoBusiness portal](/safemanagement/sector/) for the SMMs on Marriage Solemnisations and Wedding Receptions.
        <sup>11</sup> Refer to the requirements on the [GoBusiness portal](/safemanagement/general/) for the SMMs at the Workplace.

    - title: Can I serve drinks/small bites at a work-related event? (e.g. product launch/store opening)
      content: |
        F&B can be served at a work-related event if food/drinks are not the main feature of the event and the event size is capped at 50 pax. 

        Food/drinks must be served individually and consumed seated in groups of up to 5 pax with safe distancing between groups. Masks must be worn when not eating or drinking. Every participant must also meet VDS requirements. 

    - title: Can I organise a food/beverage-related workshop/talk in F&B establishment? (e.g. wine appreciation or cooking workshop) 
      content: |
        No. Live entertainment, including speeches, are not allowed within F&B establishments. The chef would not be allowed to conduct a workshop/talk while in the F&B establishment. 

        Educational workshops, where tasting is minimal, can be organised outside of F&B establishments. Trainers should remain masked throughout and cue students when they can unmask briefly to sample the food/beverage. Workshop providers and trainers should tailor the workshops to minimise unmasking and talking during sampling.

        F&B must be served in individual portions, and participants must be seated while consuming the food and drinks. Every participant must also meet VDS requirements.

    - title: Can I have a pop-up kiosk or engage a food truck to do an event at public and common areas? 
      content: |
        No. Pop up kiosks or food trucks are not permitted at public and common areas such as mall atriums, public transport nodes, HDB estates and common corridors.

    - title: Will vaccines other than Moderna/Pfizer be recognised for VDS?
      content: |
        PSAR approved vaccines (i.e. Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or Moderna vaccines currently administered under the National Vaccination Programme), as well as vaccines on the [World Health Organisation's Emergency Use Listing](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} (WHO EUL) (such as Sinovac-CoronaVac, Sinopharm, and AstraZeneca SKBio, Serum Institute of India, Janssen) are recognised for VDS. 

        Please refer to MOM's information sheet for more details of the requirements on VDS at [https://go.gov.sg/vdsmminfo](https://go.gov.sg/vdsmminfo){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

    - title: Do I have to check the vaccination status for customers doing takeaways?
      content: |
        There is no need to conduct VDS checks for customers doing takeaways. However, it is your responsibility to ensure that these customers do not consume food and drinks on the premises. There should be clearly demarcated waiting areas for customers doing takeaways.

    - title: Do I need to do SafeEntry at my F&B establishment? 
      content: |
        TraceTogether-only SafeEntry must be implemented for all dine-in customers and visitors at F&B establishments, including at food courts. Delivery personnel picking up food orders and take-away customers are not required to do SafeEntry as their presence at the F&B establishment is transient.  

        All establishments must require their employees and vendors to do SafeEntry check-in via TT-only SE.  

    - title: I am an unvaccinated food delivery rider that needs to pick up orders from F&B establishments in malls. Am I exempted from VDS?
      content: |
        The Workforce Vaccination Measures (WVM) apply to all employees, including self-employed persons (SEPs) such as food delivery personnel. For food delivery personnel, this means that they will have to adhere to WVM for entry to workplaces such as delivery platform’s HQ, malls and standalone F&B outlets. 

        Only employees who are fully vaccinated, certified to be medically ineligible or have recovered from COVID-19 within 180 days, can return to the workplace. The concession for unvaccinated employees to be able to enter the workplace with a valid negative PET from an MOH-approved COVID-19 test provider within 24 hours of entering the workplace has been removed from 1 February 2022.

    - title: I am an unvaccinated individual under one of the VDS exceptions (e.g., unvaccinated caregiver fetching a child below 12 years old from childcare centre). Can I visit other areas in the malls aside from the declared purpose?
      content: |
        No, unvaccinated individuals under VDS exemptions must leave the mall after they have fulfilled the declared purpose.

    - title: I am an unvaccinated individual and I would like to visit the mall. May I take a Pre-Event Testing (PET) and visit the mall?
      content: |
        Unvaccinated individuals are no longer able to present a negative Pre-Event Test (PET) result to enter VDS settings such as shopping malls. Only those who are fully vaccinated, have recovered from COVID-19, are medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme or are unvaccinated children aged 12 years and below (i.e. born in or after 2010) will be allowed to enter settings where VDS is implemented. From 1 March 2022, children born in 2009 who turn 13 in 2022 will need to be fully vaccinated to enter venues and participate in activities with VDS.

    - title: My shop offers hairdressing/manicure/pedicure services, and is considered part of the personal care services sector. Do I also need to implement VDS?
      content: |
        No, you do not need to. VDS is to be implemented for personal care services that require customers to remove their masks for the duration of the service. For example, make-up services, facial treatments and saunas. 

    - title: Can I allow a foreign customer who received his/her PSAR-approved vaccines overseas and provides proof of this vaccination to dine in my F&B establishment/ partake in personal care services provided at my shop?
      content: |
        Hard-copy and digital overseas vaccination certs are not recognised. 

        <b>All individuals aged 12 years and above</b> who have been fully vaccinated overseas with any vaccines approved under the WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) needs to get their overseas vaccination records ingested into the National Immunisation Registry (NIR). This includes Singaporean Citizens (SC), Singapore Permanent Residents (PR), Long-Term Pass Holder (LTPH) (e.g. Long-Term Visitor Pass, Work Permit, Employment Pass, S Pass, Dependent Pass, Student Pass) and Short-Term Pass Holders (STPH). For STPHs, this would only be relevant to those who intend to stay in Singapore for more than 30 days. You may call ahead to any clinic to check if they provide such services. You can also refer to [phpc.gov.sg](https://my-sgdcs.sgnet.gov.sg/personal/ESG-CY6678/Documents/phpc.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for a listing of clinics who may provide such services; please call ahead to check. The full cost of the service will be borne by the individual.

        If their overseas vaccination documents are not in English, they will need to get the documents translated by a translation service provider, notary public or embassy of the country that issued the document. Both the original overseas vaccination document and translated document must be brought along when visiting a private healthcare provider in Singapore for serology testing.

        After arriving in Singapore, the individual will need to visit a healthcare provider who will do the following:

        1. Review the individual's overseas vaccination documentation - either the original hard copy vaccination certificate or digital vaccination certificate (with translated document where applicable).
        
        2. Perform a serology test.
        
        3. Update the individual's overseas COVID-19 vaccination record(s) to NIR as long as the individual (i) has overseas COVID-19 vaccination documentation, and (ii) whose serology test result is positive.
        
        4. Individuals will see their vaccinations status on TraceTogether or HealthHub app within 24 hours after clinic has notified NIR of their overseas COVID-19 vaccination records.

    - title: Why are overseas vaccination certificates not recognised for VDS?
      content: |
        Overseas vaccine certificates (hard or softcopy) will not be accepted for VDS because it is difficult for individual establishments to verify the authenticity of these certificates which are issued in different formats and languages. 

    - title: How do I conduct VDS verification for foreign visitors?
      content: |
        All travellers, including those on VTL, will be required to download the TraceTogether app or rent a TraceTogether token during their stay in Singapore.

        Travellers who are vaccinated overseas would get their overseas vaccinated records reflected electronically on TraceTogether to show, on demand, to be eligible for VDS. Travellers would be granted temporary vaccinated status lasting 30 days or 180 days (only for travellers who uploaded their QR codes while applying for the VTP). This can be done through: 
        
        * Uploading their digitally-verifiable vaccination certificate in their SG Arrival Card; or

    - title: Are there concessions for individuals who are medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines?
      content: |
        Those who are medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme are eligible for VDS. 

        They will need to show the 'vaccination exemption' status via the Trace-Together App/Token, HealthHub or present a hard copy memo<sup>13</sup> issued by a General Practitioner (GP) clinic, public or private healthcare institution, along with a government-issued photo identification card for entry into these premises. More details on the criteria for medical ineligibility can be found in the sample of the standard memo [here](https://go.gov.sg/acceptabledocs){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

        <sup>13</sup> To be certified as medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme, individuals may visit a doctor familiar with their medical condition, or alternatively, any clinic or hospital to obtain a hardcopy doctor-certified memo.

    - title: Can my unvaccinated workers enter the workplace with a PET done?
      content: |
        Workers who are not fully vaccinated cannot enter the workplace. These would include all third-party vendors who visit the F&B establishment, including food delivery personnel.

        Only workers who are fully vaccinated, have recovered from COVID-19 within the past 180 days or are medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme can continue to enter the workplace.

    - title: Should F&B/spa/gym staff who are unvaccinated be redeployed to other roles? How is the government protecting the jobs of unvaccinated staff affected by this policy ('vaccinate or regular test') and prevent employers from displacing/letting them go?
      content: |
        The pre-event testing (PET) concession for unvaccinated persons to go to work under the Workforce Vaccination Measures has been removed. 

        Workers who are fully vaccinated, have recovered from COVID-19 within the past 180 days or are medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme can continue to enter the workplace. 

        For unvaccinated employees whose work can be performed at home, employers may allow them to continue to work from home. For those whose work cannot be performed from home, employers can explore redeploying them to suitable jobs which can be done from home if such jobs are available, with renumeration commensurate with the responsibilities of the alternative jobs. 

        Please refer to [MOM's Requirements for Safe Management Measures at the Workplace](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more details.  

    - title: Can I ask my employees to declare their vaccination status to me?
      content: |
        Employers may ask employees for their vaccination status for business purposes e.g. business continuity planning. While employers may adopt differentiated workplace measures for vaccinated and unvaccinated employees, they should not terminate or threaten to terminate the service of unvaccinated employees on the basis of their vaccination status alone.

    - title: What are the latest measures that retail establishments and lifestyle-related services need to note?
      content: |
        Retail establishments and lifestyle-related services are to comply with the following: 

        a. From 1 February 2022, all events, irrespective of event size and whether F&B is served, must implement VDS in order to proceed. 
        b. Social gatherings of up to 5 persons are allowed. In line with this, retail establishments are to ensure at least one-metre spacing between groups of customers (of up to 5 persons). Malls should also ensure that crowds do not gather at atriums or common spaces, and discourage the consumption of food and drinks at such spaces.
        c. The occupancy limit for malls and large standalone stores<sup>14</sup> is one person per 10 sqm of Gross Floor Area (GFA).<br>The operating capacity<sup>15</sup> for Commercial Family Entertainment Centres will remain at a maximum of one person per 10 sqm of usable space or 50% of the operating capacity, whichever is lower<sup>16</sup>. FEC operators should take note that group booking comprising unvaccinated children aged 12 years and below old must be from the same household. 
        d. Services and activities in higher-risk settings, which require masks to be removed, are allowed to resume in groups of up to 5 persons if customers are fully vaccinated. These include personal care services (e.g. facial treatments, make-up services and saunas), Food & Beverage (F&B) dine-in and indoor high-intensity/ mask-off sports services. 
        e. From 18 February 2022, all workers<sup>17</sup> in malls, large standalone stores and supermarket outlets, as well as those in personal care services (e.g. facial and nail services, spas/saunas, massage establishments, hairdressing, and make-up services) will no longer be required to conduct Fast and Easy Test Rostered Routine Testing, or FET RRT. This is a change from the current practice where all workers in these establishments are to be tested once every 7 days under FET RRT, regardless of vaccination status.

        <sup>14</sup> These refer to standalone stores > 930 sqm (or 10,000 sqft) of GFA.
        <sup>15</sup> Commercial Family Entertainment Centres with > 930 sqm (or 10,000 sqft) of Gross Floor Area can review operating capacity by referring to SMMs for Attractions released by STB, and submit refreshed proposals to [enquiry@enterprisesg.gov.sg](mailto:enquiry@enterprisesg.gov.sg).
        <sup>16</sup> Facilities below 50 sqm can admit up to 5 persons. This does not include workers.
        <sup>17</sup> This refers to all mall management workers as well as all tenants and vendors who work in the malls, large standalone stores and supermarkets, including those working in office spaces of the shops, business owners, store managers, all part-time and full-time workers, third-party contracted workers based in malls and all other workers who work at the premises, e.g. cleaners, promoters.

    - title: How can supermarket manage queues now that the measures may result in more people buying groceries to cook at home?
      content: |
        Supermarket retailers should implement crowd management measures (e.g. limiting the number of shoppers within the store at any one time) to ensure that one metre spacing can be maintained between shoppers. They would also need to limit groups of customers entering the store to no more than 5 persons, as well as maintain orderly queues in-store, and at entrance to store.

        Supermarkets are also encouraged to provide dedicated shopping hours for vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, persons with disabilities and pregnant women. This can help to reduce intermingling to better protect those who are more vulnerable to COVID-19.

    - title: Are TCM patients allowed to take off their masks during their consultation? 
      content: |
        Patients of licensed Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners are allowed to remove their masks during their consultation/treatment, if required. They must wear their masks as soon as their consultation/treatment is completed.

    - title: Can I have a mascot for activations / events in retail spaces and malls?
      content: |
        Roving mascots are allowed for retail spaces and malls. However, this allowance will be subjected to the following conditions:

        a. Maximum of 2 roving mascots are allowed at any time 
        
        b. Mascots shall not distribute any food items (e.g. candies and treats); and
        
        c. Mascots shall maintain safe distancing and minimise interactions with members of the public

    - title: What kind of activations are allowed in mall atriums and common areas?
      content: |
        As per our latest retail advisory, activities and events are not permitted to resume in public and common area.

        However, static displays including visual merchandise displays, car displays, festive decors, art exhibitions, etc. are allowed. These are not considered as an activity or event as there is no commercial activity or solicitation conducted onsite.

        Event organisers and premise owners must manage any potential crowding within or around the installations. Event organisers and premises owners will be asked to cease this activation if they are continually found to be unable to manage the crowds and enforce 1m safe distancing between individuals / prevailing group sizes.
