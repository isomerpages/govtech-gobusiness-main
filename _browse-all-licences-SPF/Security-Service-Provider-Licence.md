<p>With effect from 15 Sep 2025, Security Service Provider&rsquo;s licences will be valid for 3 years, and will cost $126.</p>
<p>Please note that there will be legislative changes to the <strong>Private Security Industry (Security Service Providers) Regulations 2009</strong> with effect from 15 Sep 2025.</p>
<p>Besides the new licence tenure of 3 years at a fee of $126, other changes include the change in reporting requirements with respect to changes of business names and officers, i.e. directors and partners, of security service providers. For change of directors/partners and change of business name, licensees should update ACRA directly within 14 days of the change, and there is no longer a requirement to inform PRD if this had already been done. &nbsp;You may refer to the SPF&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.police.gov.sg/e-Services/Police-Licences/Security-Service-Provider-Licence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> for more details.
