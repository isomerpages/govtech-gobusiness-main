<h3>FAQ</h3>

<ol>
<li>
    <strong>What type of events will be declared as Special Events?
</strong><br>        
Police will declare the following events as Special Events:<br>
<br>i) A public event that is expected to attract a crowd size of 5,000 people or more, at any point in time; or<br>
ii) A private event that is expected to attract a crowd size of 10,000 people or more, at any point in time; or<br>
iii) An event that the Police assesses to be of higher-risk<br>
<br>Event organisers are required to notify the Police if they reasonably expect their event to have a crowd size exceeding 5,000 people (public event) or 10,000 people (private event).
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>What is a private/ public event?
</strong><br>        
A private event is one that is exclusive to specific invited guests. The event organiser should have the details of the attendees or know them from an existing database before the invite for it to be considered a private invitation. An event that is open to any member of public (even if they have to purchase tickets or register in advance), is a public event.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>I am running a non-ticketed event. How do I gauge whether the attendance at my event will exceed 5,000 persons?
</strong><br>        
Event organisers should estimate the crowd size based on either previous years' attendance (if available), the crowd size of other similar events, and/or the maximum capacity that the event venue can accommodate. If organisers are not prepared to accommodate more than 5,000 persons during the event, organisers should put in place measures to limit attendance or access to the event. This will prevent over-crowding and is also important for public order and safety.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Do I have to notify the Police if my event takes place over an extended period of time with transient attendees coming and leaving (eg. road show across 3 days), totalling to more than 5,000 pax?
</strong><br>        
Event organisers are required to notify the Police if they expect the maximum crowd size for a public event to exceed 5,000 pax at any point in time. There is no legal obligation to notify the Police if the event meets the crowd size threshold (5000 pax for public event; 10,000 pax for private event) over a period of time, but not at a single point in time.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>If I initially planned to sell only 4,000 tickets, but eventually decided to expand the sales to more than 5,000 due to popular demand, do I need to inform Police and will I be required to put in place security measures?
</strong><br>        
Event organisers should anticipate such scenarios early as part of prudent and responsible planning. If an event organiser makes a last-minute decision to expand the event capacity that exceeds the crowd size criteria, he/she must inform the Police immediately. The Commissioner of Police will designate the event as a Security Event and the event organiser will be required to put in place security measures. It is an offence if event organisers fail to notify the Police or notify the Police fewer than 28 days before the start of the event.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>How do I notify the Police of my event?
</strong><br>        
Please submit a Notice of Intention to Organise an Event at the Gobusiness portal, https://eadviser.gobusiness.gov.sg/events?src=run&grow_licences_fs
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>When do I have to submit the Notice of Intent to the Police?
</strong><br>        
Event organisers are required by law to submit the Notice of Intention to Organise an Event at least 28 days before the start of the event. We encourage organisers to get in touch with the Police as soon as they start planning for the event, so that there is ample time for the Police to work with them on the required security measures.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Are there any organisations (eg. statutory board) or types of event that is exempted from notifying the Police of their events?
</strong><br>        
No, there are no exemptions from the requirement to submit the Notice of Intention if organising events that reasonably expected to have a crowd size exceeding 5,000 people (public event) or 10,000 people (private event).
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>When will the Police inform me of the security measures that I have to put in place for my event?
</strong><br>        
After receiving the Notice of Intention to Organise an Event, Police will conduct a preliminary assessment of the event and inform the organiser whether the event will be declared a Special Event, within 14 days. Police may contact the organiser to understand more about the event and request for information on the proposed security measures.
<br><br>
Thereafter, Police will issue a set of written directions listing the required security measures for the event. Organisers are required to implement the stipulated measures and comply with Police's directions under this written direction. Police may conduct audits to ensure that these measures are put in place.
  </li>
 <li>
    <strong>Are venue owners required to notify the Police of crowded events held at their venues?
</strong><br>        
The event organisers are responsible for notifying the Police and to implement the security requirements stipulated by Police. However, venue owners could play a part to check with the organisers whether they have submitted the Notice of Intention and complied with the stipulated conditions.
  </li>

 <li>
    <strong>I am already putting in place security measures such as deploying security officers to check bags. Do I need to put in place more security measures?
</strong><br>        
The measures required for each event would vary depending on the nature of the event and Police's security assessment. Police will work with the organisers closely and balance the need for adequate security measures, possible inconvenience caused to the public and cost impact on the organisers.
  </li>

 <li>
    <strong>Do I still need to apply for a Police permit, or a PEMA licence, if I have already submitted the Notice of Intention to Organise an Event?
</strong><br>        
Yes, event organisers are still required to apply for the relevant Police permits or entertainment licenses, if the event requires. For example, an event promoting a cause or campaign, demonstrating support or opposition to view or action, or to commemorate an event will still require a Police Permit. Events providing public entertainments as defined in the PEA will still require a PEA licence issued by Police or IMDA.
  </li>

 <li>
    <strong>Is there a fee to be paid when submitting the Notice of Intention to Organise an Event?
</strong><br>        
No, there will be no fees involved. Separate fees for the Police permit or a PEMA permit will continue to apply.
  </li>

 <li>
    <strong>When should I submit the Notice of Intent to Organise an Event?
</strong><br>        
You should submit the notice no less than 28 days before the proposed date of the event.
