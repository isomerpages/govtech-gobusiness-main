<H3>Application Details</H3>

<p>An extension hours liquor licence always rides on a valid liquor licence or temporary liquor licence. It cannot be valid by itself, without an accompanying liquor licence or temporary liquor licence. The extension hours period applied for can only be within the validity period of the liquor licence. An applicant may apply for both a new liquor/temporary liquor licence, and extension hours liquor licence at the same time.</p>
