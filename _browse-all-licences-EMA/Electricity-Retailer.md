<H3>Application Details</H3>

<p>Required for the retail of electricity to contestable consumers.</p>
<p>Retail electricity licensees (electricity retailers) are entities authorised by the Energy Market Authority (EMA) to retail electricity to contestable consumers.</p>
<p>There are two types of electricity retailers: Market Participant Retailers (MPRs) and Non-Market Participant Retailers (NMPRs).</p>
<p>MPRs have to be registered with the Energy Market Company (EMC) to purchase electricity from the National Electricity Market of Singapore (NEMS) to sell to contestable consumers.</p>
<p>NMPRs need not register with EMC to participate in the NEMS, as they will purchase electricity indirectly from the NEMS through the Market Support Services Licensee (MSSL).</p>
<p>For more information on becoming a retailer, you may refer to EMA&apos;s Guide to Becoming a Licensed Electricity Retailer available via <a href="https://www.ema.gov.sg/regulations-licences/licences/industry-licences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.ema.gov.sg/regulations-licences/licences/industry-licences</a>.</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Does the licence guarantee a registration to the Market Company?</strong><br>The issuance of a licence does not guarantee your registration as a market participant by the Market Company.</li>
    <li><strong>Are there any requirements to be met?</strong><br>Please note the following two requirements to be met by each retailer after being issued an Electricity Retailer Licence before it can commence retailing electricity:<br><br><u>Requirement 1:</u> Pass the Market Trial conducted by SP Group. For more information, please refer to the Open Electricity Market&apos;s website (<a href="https://www.openelectricitymarket.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.openelectricitymarket.sg</a>); and&nbsp;<br><br><u>Requirement 2:</u> Satisfy EMA&apos;s requirements for participation in the Open Electricity Market. For more information, please email EMA_MDSD_RETAIL@ema.gov.sg.&nbsp;<br><br>Retailers who only meet Requirement 1 (i.e., passed the Market Trial conducted by SP Group) can only retail electricity to business consumers with an average monthly consumption of at least 2MWh.&nbsp;<br><br>Retailers must meet both requirements before they can start retailing electricity to (i) business consumers with an average monthly consumption of less than 2MWh, and (ii) all residential consumers.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Additional Information</strong>

<p>The annual licence fee is payable each April for the Financial Year starting 1 April. The initial licence fee payable upon issuance of the licence is pro-rated based on the number of days remaining in the current Financial Year.</p>
<p>You may contact EMA directly if you require further details on the fees for each licence class.</p>
