<p>Some aerial activities can potentially pose a hazard to air navigation, either due to the close proximity between an object in the air and an overflying aircraft, or an object may cause an obstruction along the flight path. As such, prior clearance needs to be sought from CAAS before interested parties carry out such activities. By accessing this page, applicants would be able to apply for the following aerial activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Release of Balloons</li>
<li>Release of Sky Lanterns</li>
<li>Kite Flying / Parasailing</li>

<ul>
<li><Strong>When do I need to apply for a permit?</Strong><BR>
A permit is not required when an aerial activity is conducted within its allowable limits. Nevertheless, you may need to submit a notification to CAAS by emailing the details to <a href="mailto:caas_ats_ansp@caas.gov.sg">caas_ats_ansp@caas.gov.sg</a>. You can visit the online map at <a href="https://www.onemap.gov.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.onemap.gov.sg/</a> to check the proximity of a particular location to the airports, air bases and other restricted areas in relation to aerial activities. In the map, click on the "Nearby", then click on the "Safety and Security" drop-down menu on the left of the map. You can add on the required layers to the map. The layers that should be referred to in relation to aerial activities are (i) "Areas within 10km of aerodromes", (ii) "Areas within 5km of aerodromes", "Areas within Danger Areas", "Areas within Prohibited Areas" and "Areas within Restricted Areas".<BR></li>
<li><Strong>How do I apply for a permit or submit a notification?</Strong><BR>
The submission of an application for a permit is free of charge, and can be done through the online form. Please allow for 7 working days for our processing of your application, as our assessment will have to be conducted in consultation with other agencies such as the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF).<BR></li>
<li><Strong>What would happen if I do not apply for the required permit?</Strong><BR>
It is an offence to conduct an aerial activity without obtaining the required permit. Anyone convicted of such an offence may be fined up to $20,000. Repeat offenders may be fined up to $40,000, and/or imprisoned for up to 15 months.</li>
