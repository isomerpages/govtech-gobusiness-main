<H3>Application Details</H3>

<p>The conduct of ship crossing can potentially affect safety of air navigation either due to the close proximity between the vessel and an overflying aircraft, or the vessel may cause an obstruction along the flight path. As such, prior clearance needs to be sought from CAAS before interests parties carry any ship crossings to the North and South of Changi Airport.</p>
