<p>The Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) was established on 1 April 2013 to oversee key aspects of children's development below the age of 7, across both kindergartens and child care centres. ECDA serves as the regulatory and developmental authority for all Early Childhood Development Centres (ECDCs) in Singapore, which provide care and/or education to children below 7 years of age.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Do I need to apply for this licence?</strong><br>
    Early Childhood Development Centres (ECDCs) are governed by the Early Childhood Development Centres Act and Regulations. You are required to obtain an ECDC licence to operate a centre. It is an offence under Section 6(1) of the Early Childhood Development Centres Act 2017 to operate a centre without a licence.
    <p>Section 6(3) states that a person who contravenes the above "shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both; and in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $1,000 for every day or part of a day during which the offence continues after conviction".</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>What supporting documents do I need to submit?</strong><br>
    You can find the document checklist and site visit checklist in the 'Guide and Application to Set Up An Early Childhood Development Centre'. Refer to the "Document Checklist" for the list of supporting documents to be submitted. Refer to "Site Visit Checklist" and conduct a self-assessment to ensure the premises meet the requirements of an ECDC prior to the Regulation Officer's visit.</li>
    <li><strong>How soon can my application be processed?</strong><br>
    The normal processing time for an application is 14 working days upon ECDA's confirmation of a complete application. This includes clearances from relevant authorities, submission of all supporting documents and the clearance of premises' suitability as an ECDC on the day of licensing visit, whichever is latest.</li>
    <li><strong>What are the clearances from relevant authorities required before I could commence operation?</strong><br>You need to obtain clearances from relevant authorities such as Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA), Fire Safety &amp; Shelter Department (FSSD), Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and Public Utility Board (PUB) for your site when necessary. In addition, the National Environment Agency (NEA)'s advice should be sought for premises located in industrial buildings. The licence to operate an ECDC would only be issued upon obtaining clearances from the relevant authorities.</li>
    <li><strong>Do I have to separately apply for the extension of Government Child Care Subsidy if I am holding a Class A and/or B Licence?</strong><br>
    No, you do not have to apply Government Child Care Subsidy separately. Upon licence approval, the administration of child care subsidy will automatically be approved as well.</li>
