<H3>Application Details</H3>

<p>With effect from 21 Nov 08, any ship having a gross tonnage greater than 1,000 that enters or leaves the port of Singapore is required to carry on board a Bunker Convention Certificate (BCC), to attest that insurance or other financial security to cover liability for bunker oil pollution damage is in place.</p>
<p>An oil tanker having a gross tonnage greater than 1,000, whether actually carrying oil in bulk (i.e. when laden) or with oil residues onboard during the voyage following carriage of oil (i.e. on ballast voyage) would already be covered by the Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1992 (CLC 92) and need not carry a BCC when entering or leaving the port of Singapore.</p>
<p>However, an oil tanker which is greater than 1,000 GT would be required to carry a BCC in the exceptional circumstance where she is operating in completely "clean" condition, i.e. when it can be proven that there are no residues from the carriage of oil in, or remaining in its cargo tanks.</p>
<p>All vessels applying for Port Clearance under the Sea Trial Scheme are also required to comply with this regulation.</p>
<p>Currently, all ships calling at the port of Singapore are required to submit a Notification of Arrival (NOA) prior to their arrival. With effect from 21 Nov 08, all ships will need to indicate in the NOA, if the ship possesses a valid BCC issued by a Convention Party.</p>
