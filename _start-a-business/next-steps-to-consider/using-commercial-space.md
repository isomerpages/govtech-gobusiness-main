## Finding A Business 

### Overview

![Using commercial space](/images/start/StartSJ_StartSJ_Commercial Spaces.jpg)

If youâ€™re interested to lease or buy a space for your business, you must first check if Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) has approved it for your business activities (e.g. restaurant, fitness centre). You can check this on [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} or refer to the property use guidelines on [URA's website](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Property/Business/Change-Use-of-Property-for-Business/Assessment-Criteria){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

### Applying for Change of Use

If the location you want is not approved for your business activities, you will need to apply for planning permission to change the use of the premises. You can submit an application for Change of Use on [GoBusiness Licensing](https://licence1.business.gov.sg/feportal/web/frontier/home){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
