## Using commercial space

![Using commercial space](/images/start/StartSJ_StartSJ_Commercial Spaces.jpg)

Depending on the nature of your business, you may need the use of commercial space (eg: retail, food & beverage or providing services such as tuition). Before leasing or buying commercial space, you should find out what you can or cannot do with the premises. You can check if a property is approved for your intended use with our e-Adviser for Premises Use.

If you intend to operate your business at a shophouse, you may check the allowable uses of the premises on [URA SPACE](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} or refer to the property use guidelines on [URA's website](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Property/Business/Change-Use-of-Property-for-Business/Assessment-Criteria){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. If planning permission is required to change the use of the premises, you can submit an application on [GoBusiness Licensing](https://licence1.business.gov.sg/feportal/web/frontier/home){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
