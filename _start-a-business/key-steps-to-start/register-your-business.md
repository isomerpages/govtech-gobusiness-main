### How to register a business

Registering a business involves two transactions: applying for a business name followed by business registration. Go to [Step 3](/start-a-business/reserve-your-business-name/) (Reserve your business name) to find out how to apply for a business name.
Once the name has been approved, you can proceed with business registration.

### Unique Entity Number (UEN) and Business Profile

Upon successful registration of your new business, your business will be issued a [Unique Entity Number (UEN)](https://www.uen.gov.sg/ueninternet/faces/pages/admin/aboutUEN.jspx){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. The UEN is your business' unique identification number that will be used in all transactions with government agencies.

A [free copy of Business Profile](https://www.acra.gov.sg/about-bizfile/updates-and-announcements/provision-of-free-business-profiles){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for your business will be emailed to the person filing the application.
