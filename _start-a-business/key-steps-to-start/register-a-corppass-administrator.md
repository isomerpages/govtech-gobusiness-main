Now that you've registered your business, the next thing you must have to transact with Singapore Government agencies is a Corppass Administrator (Admin) account. Corppass is a single corporate digital identity for your business, accessed via your personal Singpass. Each business entity can have up to 2 Corppass Admins.

**Corppass Admins can do the following:**

- Manage users' access to digital services
- Customise digital service access of individual users within the entity
- Authorise third party service providers to transact on your behalf for selected digital services

### There are two ways to register for a Corppass Administrator Account
