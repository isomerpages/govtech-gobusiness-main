### Employee CPF Contributions

You may choose to hire employees under the Home Office Scheme.

Under the CPF Act, as an employer, you’re required to pay CPF contributions for your employees who are Singapore Citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents and who are earning total wages of more than $50 per month. Use this [guide by CPF](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/employer/employer-obligations/how-much-cpf-contributions-to-pay){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to work out the amount of CPF contributions you need to pay.

### Taxation

If your home business is non-registered or registered as a sole proprietorship,  partnership, or limited liability partnership, your income must be declared as personal tax under “Business Income”.

If your business is registered under the Companies Act or any law in force in Singapore, the profits of your company will be taxed under corporate tax. 

You may refer to more detailed guidelines by IRAS for [taxation matters](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/self-employed/new-to-self-employed-income/a-self-employed-person's-tax-obligations/basic-guide-for-self-employed-persons){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

Registering for GST is compulsory if your taxable turnover at the end of the calendar year is more than $1 million OR you reasonably expect the turnover to exceed $1 million for the next 12 months. Alternatively, you may also choose to voluntarily register for GST subject to [these conditions](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/gst-registration-deregistration/factors-to-consider-before-registering-voluntarily-for-gst){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
