![Import Exports](/images/grow/RunandGrow_ImportExport.jpg)

If you wish to engage in import and/or export activities in Singapore, you will need to [activate your entity's Customs Account](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/new-traders-and-registration-services/registration-services/activate-customs-account){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} with Singapore Customs. After that, your entity may register as a Declaring Agent (DA) to apply for customs permits or certificates via [TradeNet](https://www.tradenet.gov.sg/tradenet/login.portal){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} or appoint a Declaring Agent to do so on your entity's behalf.

For more information on the activation of Customs Account and permit applications, please read the [Quick Guide for New Traders and Registration Services](https://www.customs.gov.sg/businesses/new-traders-and-registration-services/overview){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} on the Singapore Customs website.
