### Submit returns

Returns are additional information you may need to submit for certain licences. Here is a [list of licences that require submission of returns](/licences/submit-returns/).

After you apply, the relevant government agencies will advise you on submitting returns. For enquiries, you can [contact the licensing agency](/contact-us/agencies/) directly.
