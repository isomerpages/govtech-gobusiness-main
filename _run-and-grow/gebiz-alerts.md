### Be the first to know about government procurement opportunities for your business to stay competitive. 

GeBIZ Alerts is a daily email service that keeps you updated on business opportunities posted on Government Electronic Business (GeBIZ), the Singapore government's procurement website. Instead of manually checking GeBIZ for tender notices, you can now automatically receive daily updates, customised according to your preferences.

[Important Notice] Gebiz Alert service on GoBusiness was discontinued on 28 February 2025. Please note that subscriptions and alerts will no longer be available after this date. 

For alternative ways to obtain GeBiz information, please visit [https://www.gebiz.gov.sg/business-alerts.html](https://www.gebiz.gov.sg/business-alerts.html). 

We apologise for any inconvenience caused and thank you for your understanding.
