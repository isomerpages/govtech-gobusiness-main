## Step 4: Claim Absentee Payroll funding

After your employees have completed the skills training course, the next step would be to claim for absentee payroll (AP) funding by making a simple declaration.

**Claiming absentee payroll funding**

Absentee Payroll (AP) funding is a grant to help defray some manpower costs incurred when you send your Singaporean, Permanent Resident and LTVP+ employees for SSG-funded training.  

- AP funding rate: Flat rate fixed at S$4.50 per hour  

- Each organisation’s cap: S$100,000 per calendar year

You will be asked to declare your employees' hourly salary information (before CPF deduction) on the Enterprise Portal for Jobs and Skills for AP claim. Use the [AP calculator](https://www.ssg.gov.sg/absentee-payroll-calculator.html){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to find out the indicative amount you can claim. 

**Where to access the claims services**

All claim services can be accessed on the [AP funding page](https://sfec.enterprisejobskills.gov.sg/Callbackhandler/Prelogin.aspx). AP funding will be disbursed via PayNow within two and a half weeks after submission of the AP Declaration.
