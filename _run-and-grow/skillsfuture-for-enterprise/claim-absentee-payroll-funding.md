## Step 4: Claim Absentee Payroll funding

After your employees have completed the skills training course, the next step would be to claim for Absentee Payroll (AP) funding by making a simple declaration.

### Claiming absentee payroll funding

Absentee Payroll (AP) funding is a grant to help defray some manpower costs incurred when you send your Singaporean, Permanent Resident and LTVP+ employees for SSG-funded training.  

- AP funding rate: Flat rate fixed at S$4.50 per hour  
- Each organisation’s cap: S$100,000 per calendar year

You will be asked to declare your employees’ hourly salary information (before CPF deduction) on the Enterprise Portal for Jobs and Skills for AP claim. 

**Where to access the claims services**

All claim services can be accessed on the [AP funding page](https://sfec.enterprisejobskills.gov.sg/Callbackhandler/Prelogin.aspx){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. AP funding will be disbursed via PayNow within two and a half weeks after submission of the AP Declaration.
