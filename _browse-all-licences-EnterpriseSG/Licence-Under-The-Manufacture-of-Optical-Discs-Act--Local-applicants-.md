<H3>Application Details</H3>

<p>
The Manufacture of Optical Discs Act serves to enhance our regulatory system for the manufacture of optical discs by introducing further safeguards to protect rights of intellectual property rights holders. Any person that intends to manufacture optical discs as defined under the Manufacture of Optical Discs Act "MODA" in Singapore, for sale or other commercial purpose, must first obtain a valid MODA license from the Registrar of Optical Discs.
</p>
<p>
The 5-year renewable MODA license is location specific, which means that the manufacturer may only manufacture optical discs in the premises stated in the license.
