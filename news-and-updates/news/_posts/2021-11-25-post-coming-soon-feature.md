Interactions with the Government are about to get a lot simpler and seamless for business owners with a brand new GoBusiness Dashboard coming soon in early 2022!

### An intuitive dashboard for you, by you

The new dashboard is developed in close collaboration with businesses through extensive research and user testing.

From wanting more prompts and reminders for important tasks to needing immediate technical support, GoBusiness unearthed a wealth of insights about what would help businesses before getting down to designing the dashboard.

Here's what businesses can look forward to with the new GoBusiness Dashboard:

### Fresh new design

With a **cleaner and neater** layout, business users can easily find all the **essential information and e-Services** they need via the dashboard and get instant access to **support and help**.

### Applications made simpler

With a **single, personalised dashboard** to support users through the whole business journey, businesses will get integrated and easy access to over 300 Government-to-Business services. Users can apply and keep track of all their transactions via the dashboard, and be prompted if any action is required.

### Personalised guidance

To better cater to the unique needs of businesses, the new dashboard will also provide recommendations that are tailored to their individual business profiles. These include grants or licences that may be relevant for the business.
