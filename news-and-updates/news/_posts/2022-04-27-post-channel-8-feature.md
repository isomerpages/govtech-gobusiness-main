Channel 8 News featured GoBusiness in its Morning Express programme on 27 April 2022. The 7-minute feature showcased how the GoBusiness platform streamlines business processes through the experience of two businesses - Ann Huat & Company and Zyrup Media.

Ann Huat & Company is an industrial gas and aluminum supplier established in the 1960s. The third-generation heir of Ann Huat & Co, Andy Teo recounted the lack of available information in the past when he had to apply for a licence with the Singapore Civil Defence Force for storage of flammable gas cylinders. With the launch of GoBusiness, Andy was able to easily renew his licence, and even apply for grants via the platform.

Joel Lim, Manager Director of Zyrup Media, a newly incorporated digital publication and media house, leveraged GoBusiness to facilitate the company’s start-up process. Joel said that the GoBusiness start-up guide served as a playbook for him as he just had to follow the steps listed in the guide to get the company registered.
