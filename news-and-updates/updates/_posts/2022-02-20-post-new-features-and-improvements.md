For users looking to start a new business, these features can help ensure a smooth transition:

**Step-by-step-guidance** Users just have to answer a few questions on the [e-Adviser for Starting a Business](https://eadviser.gobusiness.gov.sg/startabusiness?src=news){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, to generate their very own Guided Journey - a detailed walkthrough for registering a business before completing the registration process<sup>*</sup>, all on GoBusiness. Each application form also comes with a summary of essential information and required documents to guide first-time business owners. Users can also read the [Start-up Guide](/start-a-business/?src=news) to obtain a clearer idea on what to prepare.

###### <sup>*</sup>This currently applies only to sole proprietorships and partnerships.

**Brand name availability** The e-Adviser for Starting a Business allows users to see whether their brand name is available as a trademark, social media handles, and more.

**Wide range of e-Advisers available** GoBusiness has e-Advisers to guide new business owners at every step of the way. Users can start out by finding out the most suitable business structure for their business using the [e-Adviser for Business Structure](https://eadviser.gobusiness.gov.sg/businessstructure?src=news){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} before embarking on the business registration process<sup>*</sup> using the [e-Adviser for Starting a Business](https://eadviser.gobusiness.gov.sg/startabusiness?src=news){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

They can also use the [e-Adviser for Premises Use](https://eadviser.gobusiness.gov.sg/premisesusecheck?src=start_using_commercial_space/?src=news){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to check if their premises are currently approved for the intended use, or even find out which licences to apply for with this directory of [e-Advisers for Licences](/licences/find-licence-by-sector/?src=news){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

###### <sup>*</sup>This currently applies only to sole proprietorships and partnerships.

**Full integration with the GoBusiness Dashboard** After using the e-Adviser for Starting a Business, users can stay updated on the status of their business registration<sup>*</sup> and follow up on the next steps via the GoBusiness dashboard.

It is now even easier to find and apply for the relevant government assistance schemes with these enhancements to the [e-Adviser for Government Assistance](https://eadviser.gobusiness.gov.sg/govassist?src=news){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}:

**Improved recommendations** With an enhanced interface, it is now easier to navigate the e-Adviser for Government Assistance. Users can also select sub-sectors for more specific and relevant recommendations.

**Auto-filled forms** With just one simple login via Singpass, application forms can be auto-filled with the user company information obtained from the Unique Entity Number (UEN) profile, for a faster and smoother application process.

**Seamless integration with Business Grants Portal (BGP)** Upon getting their e-Adviser results, any recommended BGP grant comes with a direct link to the relevant page on BGP to apply, without requiring users to log in again. Users can now cut down on time spent  navigating different websites.
