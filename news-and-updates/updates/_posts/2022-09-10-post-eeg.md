The Energy Efficiency Grant (EEG) is now available on GoBusiness. First announced in June 2022, the EEG is designed to help local businesses cope with energy bills amidst rising electricity costs.

The grant supports businesses in the food services, food manufacturing and retail sectors as they have been significantly affected by higher electricity prices, in terms of impact on their overall business costs.

The EEG will provide financial support for companies to invest in pre-approved energy-efficient equipment such as refrigerators, LED lighting and air-conditioners.

The EEG also complements the Government’s ongoing efforts to encourage enterprises to adopt solutions that can enable them to be more sustainable and energy efficient.

Eligible companies can find out more on our [EEG page](energy-efficiency-grant/?src=news_and_update) and apply for the grant via the [Business Grants Portal (BGP)](https://www.businessgrants.gov.sg/?src=news_and_update){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
