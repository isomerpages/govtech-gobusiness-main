    <li>the solar panels also function as a roof shelter, covering an area that exceeds 10 square metres; or</li>
    <li>any other new building works, as defined under the Building Control Act.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>*Certain building works are exempted from plan submission. It is advisable to consult a Professional Engineer (PE) for Civil and Structural works to ascertain the need for structural strengthening works.</em></p>
<p>In the above circumstances, your QP would need to submit detailed structural plans and structural design calculations, as well as building plans(if applicable). Please also note that lightning protection - as required for under the SS555:2018 Code of Practice for Protection Against Lightning - for the solar modules and associated control panels must be duly complied with.</p>
