<p>The Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme for Medical Devices (CLS(MD)) is a joint initiative by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), Ministry of Health (MOH), Health Sciences Authority (HSA), and Synapxe as part of efforts to improve medical device cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Under the voluntary CLS(MD), medical devices are rated according to 4 levels of cybersecurity provisions and assessments. The cybersecurity label for medical devices would provide an indication of the level of security in medical devices. The scheme seeks to incentivise manufacturers to adopt a security-by-design approach, and to enable consumers and healthcare providers to make more informed decisions about the use of such devices.</p>
