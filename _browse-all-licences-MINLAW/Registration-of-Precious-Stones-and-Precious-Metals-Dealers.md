    <li><strong>Who needs to register?</strong>

        <p>*Examples of "regulated dealers" who carry on a business of "regulated dealing" include jewellers, bullion traders, jewellery wholesalers, jewellery retailers and secondhand goods dealers. Examples of "regulated dealers" who carry on business as intermediaries for "regulated dealing" include auction houses and trading platforms. Pawnbrokers will be excluded, as they are already subject to AML/CFT measures under the Pawnbrokers Act.</p>
        <p>Under section 6 of the Precious Stones and Precious Metals (Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) Act, you are a regulated dealer if you (a) manufacture, import, sell, offer for sale, possess for sale, or purchase for the purpose of resale any precious stone, precious metal or precious product (PSM); (b) sell or redeem any token, certificate or other instrument backed by one or more PSMs that entitles the holder to the PSM or part of it; or (c) act as an intermediary for (a) or (b).</p>
