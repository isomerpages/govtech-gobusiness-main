<H3>Application Details</H3>

<p>If you want to change the use of a property (e.g. from a shop to a restaurant, or from a restaurant to a pub), you may need to apply for planning permission for Change of Use from URA. Please note that Land Betterment Charge (LBC) may be collected by SLA for the change of use. For more information on LBC, please visit <a href="https://www.sla.gov.sg/properties/land-sales-and-lease-management/lease-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SLA’s website</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>For SLA’s properties tenanted out for interim uses or HDB's commercial properties, you are required to seek consent from SLA and HDB, respectively. Application to URA is not required if the proposal falls under one of the allowable uses. For more information, please refer to <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Circulars/dc15-05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Circular No : URA/PB/2015/05-DCG</a> for SLA properties and <a href="https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Circulars/dc11-05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Circular No : URA/PB/2011/05-DCG</a> for HDB commercial premises.</li>
<li>However, if your proposal is on vacant land or involves new structures or additions/alteration works to existing buildings, you will need to apply for planning permission for New Erection or Addition/Alteration from URA by submitting a Development Application (DA) via CORENET.  The proposed change of use of the land/building can be incorporated in the DA. For more information please visit <a href="https://safe.menlosecurity.com/https:/www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Planning-Permission/using-CORENET-eSS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/Development-Control/Planning-Permission/using-CORENET-eSS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Before signing a tenancy or purchase agreement of the property, you should check if your intended use for that property can be allowed, and obtain Change of Use Approval if it is required.</p>
<p>In addition to URA’s change of use approval, you are advised to ensure clearances/licences (if applicable) are obtained from the relevant authorities before starting the use at the premises:</p>
