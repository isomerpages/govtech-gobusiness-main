In this instance, applicants should note that the application duration could take longer. Hence to minimise delays, please ensure all documents are submitted correctly.</li>
<li>If the application is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">incomplete</span>, it will be rejected. Applicants will need to submit a new application.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stamp Duty Certificate</span></p>
<ul>
<li>If the main operator of the applicant&rsquo;s canteen, food court, coffee shop or eating house is collecting and paying stamp duties on behalf of the stall holders as part of the tenancy management process, please request a copy of the Certificate of Stamp Duty from them.</li>
<li>If the main operator issues other types of agreements in lieu of leases / tenancies (e.g. licence agreements, service agreements, etc.), please check if these agreements are subject to stamp duty. The applicant may approach IRAS for clarification and attach IRAS' clarifications as a supporting document when applying for the licence. If stamp duties are not applicable, SFA will require documentation from IRAS stating this.</li>
</ul>
