<H3>Application Details</H3>

<p>Private Hire Car Driverâ€™s Vocational Licence (PDVL) holders are allowed to provide chauffeured services using a private hire car only.</p>

<p>A Digital LTA Vocational Licence (Digital LTA VL) will be issued on the Singpass app after completing your vocational licence test, replacing the need for a physical card. If you still wish to own a physical card, you can apply for one on <a href="https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoBusiness</a> only <u>after</u> you have been issued with a Digital LTA VL.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Only Singapore citizens are eligible to apply for a PDVL. Non-Singaporean applications will NOT be accepted.</p>

<p>Your licence application/renewal will require up-to-date MediSave contributions - either paid in full or have an active GIRO arrangement with CPF Board.</p>

<p>To check your MediSave payment status or make payment arrangements for any outstanding MediSave payable, please visit the Self-employment dashboard, which you can access via <a href="https://cpf.gov.sg/MydashboardsFAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cpf.gov.sg/MydashboardsFAQ</a> (Self-employment).
