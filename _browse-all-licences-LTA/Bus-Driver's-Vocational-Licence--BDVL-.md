<H3>Application Details</H3>

<p>Bus Driver's Vocational Licence (BDVL) is required for drivers of buses registered as Private Hire Buses, School Buses or Excursion Buses, associated with fare charges. On the other hand, Bus Attendant's Vocational Licence (BAVL) allows you to work as a bus attendant on a school bus in Singapore.</p>

<p>A Digital LTA Vocational Licence (Digital LTA VL) will be issued on the Singpass app after completing your vocational licence course/test, replacing the need for a physical card.&nbsp;If you still wish to own a physical card, you can apply for one on <a href="https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoBusiness</a> only <u>after</u> you have been issued with a Digital LTA VL.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For Singapore Citizen/Singapore Permanent Resident, your licence application/renewal will require up-to-date MediSave contributions - either paid in full or have an active GIRO arrangement with CPF Board.</p>
