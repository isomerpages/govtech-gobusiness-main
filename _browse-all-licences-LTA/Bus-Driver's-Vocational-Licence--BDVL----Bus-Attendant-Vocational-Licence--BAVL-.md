 <li><strong>What is the statutory age limit for a BDVL/ BAVL?</Strong><br>
 With effect from 1 February 2011, the statutory upper age limit for BAVL has been removed, i.e., there is no maximum age for BAVL holders. In addition, the upper age limit for BDVL holders has been raised to 75 years. <strong>This applies only to BDVL holders driving Class 3 buses</strong>.<br>
 However, from 1 January 2016, the upper age limit has been extended until heavy vehicle drivers turn 75 years old. With the revision, heavy vehicle drivers (i.e. Class 4/4A and 5), aged between 70 to 74 years old, can retain their licences if they pass an annual enhanced medical examination and proficiency driving test. Hence, these drivers can continue to drive Class 4/4A buses provided they pass the above requirements by the Traffic Police</li>
 <li><strong>What are the medical requirement to apply for a BDVL/ BAVL?</Strong><br>
 Applicants who are aged 50 years and above are required to pass regular medical examinations. The frequency of medical examinations are as follows:<br>
 <strong>50 - 64 years: </strong>Once every 2 years<br>
 <strong>65 years onwards: </strong>Every year<br>
 For applicants reaching the age of 70 years, there is a requirement to undergo a special assessment to certify that they are fit to continue driving. This assessment is called the "Assessment on Fitness to Drive for Vocational Licence Holders Aged 70 years and Above". This Assessment covers a medical examination, an occupational therapy evaluation, and an on-road driving test with an occupational therapist and a driving instructor. After passing the Assessment at age 70 years, he will have to continue to pass LTA's annual medical examination at 71 and 72 years of age. This Assessment will be required once again at the age of 73 and 74 years of age before the VL holder is allowed to renew and extend his VL up to 75 years of age.<br>
 However, BAVL holders aged 65 years and above will have to pass LTA's yearly medical examination in order to continue to hold the licence.</li>
 <li><strong>How long can an applicant expect to wait for his application to LTA to be approved?</Strong><br>
 As a general guide, it will take about 30 working days for LTA to process an application for a BDVL/ BAVL, assuming that all relevant documents have been duly submitted.</li>
 <li><strong>Will non-Singapore Citizens (SPR/ FWP holder) be allowed to apply for a BDVL/ BAVL?</Strong><br>
 Yes, there will be <strong>no Citizenship restrictions on who can apply for a BDVL</strong>. However, employment letter as proof of being an employee driving for a bus company as a bus driver is required for FWP. However,<strong>BAVL is only for Singaporeans</strong>.</li>
