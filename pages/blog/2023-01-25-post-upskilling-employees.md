As we navigate the digital age, keeping our skills up to date has become more important than ever, with the World Economic Forum’s [Future of Jobs Report 2020](https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-future-of-jobs-report-2020/in-full/infographics-e4e69e4de7){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} estimating that half of the global workforce will need to undergo upskilling, as companies acknowledge that 44 per cent of the skills employees require to perform effectively will change by 2025, making career upskilling necessary to keep up with the changing demands of employees’ roles 

Whether you're a business owner or a manager in your organisation, 
understanding the benefits of upskilling and how it affects your workplace is key to future-proofing your company, as consistent training brings immense value to your team.

### The benefits of career upskilling 

Perhaps you’re looking for ways to increase efficiency in the workplace, or target specific skill gaps your team is facing. Adopting a strategic approach of upskilling – where employees learn new skills –  can help to address this, by giving employees an avenue to pick up current trends and new developments in your industry. This can help to encourage your team members to adopt a problem solving mindset, and avoid career stagnation. 

For instance, encouraging your team to familiarise themselves with courses on [Meta Blueprint](https://www.facebook.com/business/learn){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} can give them a more robust understanding of advertising platforms and digital tools, by equipping them with knowledge on how to perform functions such as how to run Facebook Ads, and optimise digital marketing campaigns. 

Engaging with upskilling initiatives enables employees to find more growth in their roles, as your team can get a better perspective of their learning and professional development goals for work and career advancement.

Upskilling can also help to boost morale: sending your team for upskilling courses is a sign that you’re taking an active interest in their future, increasing motivation in the workplace, which can raise productivity, lower attrition rates, and improve job satisfaction.

According to a [study conducted by Randstand](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/only-43-of-employees-surveyed-in-singapore-are-committed-to-staying-with-their-current-employer){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, 91 per cent of the respondents surveyed in Singapore indicated an interest in learning and development opportunities in the workplace, with 73 per cent highlighting the importance of training and development. 

### Getting started with upskilling your team

To assess if upskilling is suitable for your employees, consider coming up with a Personal Development Plan, which provides a structured approach to career upskilling, encourages employees to take ownership over their own learning and professional growth, and helps you and your employees to focus on learning content and developing the most appropriate skills.
