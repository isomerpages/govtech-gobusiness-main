Once you’ve understood the steps required from the guide, start the registration process by [choosing a business structure](/start-a-business/choose-a-business-structure/?src=gobiz_blog){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. Consider factors such as the number of owners for your venture, your business plan, and the ease of setup and maintenance for each business structure to decide which one best fits your venture. 

For more guidance, the [e-Adviser for Business Structure](https://eadviser.gobusiness.gov.sg/businessstructure?src=gobiz_blog){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} on GoBusiness lends a helping hand in the form of a simple questionnaire that suggests a recommended business structure, and helps you assess different aspects of your business. You can also find out how the Start-up Guide has [helped other business owners to take the first step in establishing their venture](/gobusiness-blog/zyrup/?src=gobiz_blog){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

So you’ve chosen your business structure and office address. What’s next? Choosing a name for your business. If you’re unsure if your company name is suitable, the [e-Adviser for Starting a Business](https://eadviser.gobusiness.gov.sg/startabusiness?src=gobiz_blog)){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} can help you [check for similar business names](https://www.singaporecompanyincorporation.sg/tool/singapore-business-name-checker/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to the one you’ve chosen, available domain names and social media handles, and whether additional approvals are required.

If you’re registering a Sole Proprietorship or Partnership, you can reserve your business name and register the company via [GoBusiness](https://dashboard.gobusiness.gov.sg/login?src=gobiz_blog){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, by logging in with your Singpass.

Once you’ve logged in, scroll down till you see the register button to register your business:

<figcaption>Click “Register”</figcaption>

This will direct you to the e-Adviser for Starting a Business, where you will be asked to enter details such as your selected business name, business structure, and activities.

After that, you’ll be led to a list of recommended steps to take in a Guided Journey, which include applying for your business name and registering your business. You can then save this by selecting “Add Guided Journey”.

Once you’ve saved your Guided Journey, follow the recommended steps to complete the process. You can also pause and continue your application any time on the GoBusiness Dashboard, and the status will be reflected under “My Submissions”. 

![GoBusiness Dashboard track application status](/images/blog/content/startabusiness 8.jpg)

If your business venture falls under other business structures, head on over to [BizFile+](https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/ngbbizfileinternet/faces/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pages/BizfileHomepage.jspx){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to register your business name directly, or appoint a registered filing agent, such as a law firm, to submit an online application. 

Upon successful registration of your new company, you will be issued a [Unique Entity Number (UEN)](https://www.uen.gov.sg/ueninternet/faces/pages/admin/aboutUEN.jspx){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} which will be used in all your transactions with government agencies.

Once you’ve reserved your business name and completed your registration, your next move is to [set up a Corppass Administrator account](/start-a-business/create-a-corppass-account/?src=gobiz_blog){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. A corporate digital identity that lets your business entity conduct business transactions with Singapore Government agencies, Corppass helps you to manage digital services such as grant applications and the filing of corporate taxes. 

Last but not least, don’t forget to [open a corporate bank account](/start-a-business/open-a-corporate-bank-account/?src=gobiz_blog){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}! 

Though it can be optional depending on your type of business, having a dedicated business bank account helps you separate personal and business transactions, which will make it much easier for you to file taxes.
