With the rapid rate of digital advancement, keeping up with technology has never been more important, as many businesses turned to digital strategies to adapt to ongoing global trends. 

While the cost of digitalisation may look daunting, digital advancement doesn’t have to take the form of exorbitant solutions. From smaller steps such as automating current work processes, to adopting cloud-based scheduling systems, it’s easy to begin your journey to increasing efficiency in the workplace with the [Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG)](/productivity-solutions-grant/?src=gobiz_blog){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.


### What is the PSG?

Launched in 2018, the PSG aims to help enterprises go digital by supporting the adoption of pre-scoped IT solutions, equipment and consultancy services, to help improve productivity in the workplace, in line with current roadmaps for industry transformation such as the Industry Digital Plans (IDPs). 

The PSG offers sector-specific solutions, including but not limited to solutions for the retail, food services, wholesale trade and logistics industries, as well as digital marketing and inventory tracking.
