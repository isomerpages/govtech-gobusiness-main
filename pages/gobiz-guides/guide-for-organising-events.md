### Propose unique events or seek partnership and collaboration with the government

### Find out which event licences and permits to apply for

Are you an event organiser organising Sports, MICE, Arts/Culture, and/or Business-to-Consumer (B2C) events such as marathons, conferences, festivals, travel fairs etc?

The e-Adviser for Events is designed to help you understand which licences and permits you need to organise your event. Answer questions about the nature of your event, and receive personalised recommendations for licences. From there, you can access the relevant application forms directly.
