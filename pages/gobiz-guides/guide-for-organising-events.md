### Propose unique events or seek partnership and collaboration with the government

The Events Proposal Box allows event organisers to propose unique event concepts for collaboration with the government, or seek government endorsements for regulatory approvals. Currently, only proposals for Sporting and MICE events are accepted.

### Find out which event licences and permits to apply for

Are you an event organiser organising Sports, MICE, Arts/Culture, and/or Business-to-Consumer (B2C) events such as marathons, conferences, festivals, travel fairs etc?

The e-Adviser for Events is designed to help you understand which licences and permits you need to organise your event. Answer questions about the nature of your event, and receive personalised recommendations for licences. From there, you can then access the relevant application forms directly on your dashboard, and be guided through a recommended application sequence.
