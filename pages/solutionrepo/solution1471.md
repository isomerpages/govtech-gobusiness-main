## Blast Freezer

## Overview

**Description**

Blast Freezers chill food from cooking temperatures ~70 degrees to about -18 degrees within 240 min. It prevents growth of micro-organisms thereby improving food safety and reduces drip/water loss from freezing. The rapid freezing function prevents large ice crystals which reduce shelf life, quality and flavour of frozen. Blast freezers should be able to be loaded with a trolley for ease of operation. 

Cost of equipment capped at $30,000 per unit
