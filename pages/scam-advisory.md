## Beware of impersonation scams

You receive a call from:

<ol>
    <li>A police officer saying you are part of an investigation – they might even accuse you of being involved in criminal activities.</li>
    <li>A bank officer saying your bank account or credit card has been compromised; or</li>
    <li>A government official (e.g. LTA, IRAS, MAS, MDDI) saying you have not paid your bill/fine or that your mobile number has been misused for scams.</li>
</ol>

The caller is even able to cite your full name and NRIC number. Sounds real?

<b>Stop! Do not believe the caller just because he/she knows your personal information, e.g. your name or NRIC number. It may be a scam!</b>

<b>Call the 24/7 ScamShield Helpline at 1799 to check if you are unsure if something is a scam.</b>

## Government officials will NEVER do these things over a phone call:

<ol>
    <li>Ask you to transfer money;</li>
    <li>Ask you to disclose banking details;</li>
    <li>Ask you to install mobile apps from unofficial app stores;</li>
    <li>Transfer your call directly to Police, <b>except when you call 995</b> for life threatening-emergencies.</li>
</ol>

If you receive an SMS from the government, make sure it is sent from the <b>gov.sg</b> SMS Sender ID*.

*Exceptions apply for National Service call-ups and emergency services. Read more about [the exceptions](https://www.sms.gov.sg/exceptions){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
