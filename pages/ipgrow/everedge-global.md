### Testimonials

*"At first glance, our business might look to be primarily based on tangible assets, but EverEdge helped us dig beneath the surface and recognise that a lot of our value is actually derived from the confidential information, data, digital content and other intangible assets we hold.   "While we initially engaged EverEdge on a valuation project, we extended our relationship due to the knowledge and insights the team brought to our table. EverEdge have assisted us with building a framework to identify and value our intangible assets, as well as helping us to mitigate risk around these assets. I would highly recommend EverEdge to anyone who wants to ensure they are fully capitalising on the value of their intangible assets."* - Aron Butcher, Head of Digital, QIC Real Estate.

*"We have had a long relationship with EverEdge, as its team helped us develop a strategy to build value in our portfolio of intangible assets. When EverEdge was appointed to advise Swisslog Healthcare on the sale of TransCar, its team was able to immediately identify the synergies with our business and the strategic value we could add to these assets if we acquired them. This transaction made sense for both OTSAW and TransCar and will allow both companies to focus on driving growth and margins in our core business' by delivering innovative solutions and great service to our customers."* - Ling Ting Ming, 
CEO & Tech Missionary, OTSAW.

*"Just like growing kiwifruit, growing a world class company, product and brand takes time and a continual focus on improving everything we do for future generations of kiwifruit growers and consumers.  We engaged Everedge to conduct an audit of our intangible asset portfolio, and to work alongside our global teams to develop a clear strategy for improvement in our management and leveraging of intangible assets.  Everedge's strategists developed a strong understanding of our business, industry and the culture of Zespri and worked with us to change the dialogue around our intangible assets and identify new opportunities for value creation.  Everedge's work opened up opportunities for us to make a genuine step change in how Zespri considers and manages intangible assets and I have every confidence that the strategic planks identified by Everedge will allow Zespri to unlock new innovative opportunities, driving substantial value for our business and Zespri growers."* - Katherine Evans, General Counsel, Zespri.
