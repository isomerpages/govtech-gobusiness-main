The goal was to reposition the brand across B2B commerce, compliance, logistics, and trade finance services. Due to the project's complexity, we engaged Louken Group to analyze our businesses and develop a scalable brand architecture. The project management, research, strategy, and advisory provided by Louken Group were thorough and insightful. Their work included distinguishing sub-brands to target specific segments. Louken Group demonstrated a keen ability to align business objectives with market research and marketing communications. I am very satisfied with Louken Group for their recommendations and guidance throughout our brand launch. I highly recommend Louken Group for any branding exercise."* - Charlene Chen, DeClout

*"We worked with Louken Group on a global rebrand of Braid Logistics. The goal was to develop a brand advantage to protect our market share against lower-priced entrants. The project management, research, strategy, and advisory provided by Louken Group were thorough and insightful, leading to the creation of HexoPure, a technology brand highlighting our polymer-science superiority. The communication systems developed were very useful for our global rollout, and the new logo enhanced our brand image to align with our value proposition.
