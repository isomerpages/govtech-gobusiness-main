## Harry Elias Partnership LLP

Our team advises clients from a wide range of sectors across South East Asia on protecting, commercialising, licensing and enforcing their IP rights. This includes patents, trade marks, designs, copyright, trade secrets and know-how.

We can assist with defending and taking action against offenders in trade mark infringement and passing-off claims as well as in patent, design and copyright litigation. We work closely with our clients to navigate the complex process of protecting their IP rights across multiple jurisdictions. We are able to undertake effective IP enforcement programmes against counterfeiters of goods circulated in the region. 

Our experience and capability extend beyond the technical knowledge of IP as our team has commercial and industry knowledge in drafting, negotiating and advising on licensing or franchising deals and transactional agreements surrounding corporate acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic business activities.
