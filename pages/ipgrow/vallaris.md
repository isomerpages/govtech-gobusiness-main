## VALLARIS

Vallaris helps entrepreneurs and CEOs with their mergers and acquisitions ("M&A") deals and disputes.

Only 1% of entrepreneurs and CEOs fund raise successfully.

Businesses often fail to raise the right type of funding at the right valuation at the right time.

Business Plan Mistakes 
Many fail without a clear What's in It For Me? ("WIIFM") for investors.

Bad Valuation 
Too low, you won't attract investors. Too high, you'll distance investors.

Can't Seal The Deal
Most entrepreneurs are not trained to attract, pitch and close accredited investors.

Vallaris' mission is to get investors & capital coming to you instead of chasing them.

### Testimonials

*"We agree with the Judge that Mun's evidence should be preferred. Mun's evidence was more credible and objective, and the conclusions he reached were well-reasoned and supported by the evidence.

[2022] SGCA 47, para 64, 66."* - Justice Steven Chong Horng Siong , Judge of Appeal, Project Succession (Appeal), The Court of Appeal of Singapore.
