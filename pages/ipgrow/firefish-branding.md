### Testimonials

*"Due to the tight labour market, we were having issues finding enough blue-collar workers for the available vacancies. The rebranding project repositioned our Hasse employer brand as the preferred employer amongst blue-collar workers. To activate the repositioning, Arnold and his team adopted a digital-first strategy. They increased brand awareness through ad platforms by iterative testing and optimisation. As a result, we increased the number of potential applicants by 214%. Overall, I would highly recommend Arnold to anyone looking for a skilled and reliable partner to help them achieve their business objectives. Their expertise, professionalism, and commitment to delivering results make them a valuable asset to any organisation."* - Hidehito Ie, Director, Hasse Pte Ltd.

*"I am writing to express my utmost satisfaction and appreciation for the exceptional rebranding work done by Jesslin Zhou and her team from Firefish.  Jesslin and her team took the time to deeply understand our cleaning company's vision and goals before embarking on the project. Throughout the project, the team consistently kept us updated on the progress and actively sought our feedback. They seamlessly incorporated our ideas into the final design, showcasing their professionalism, creativity, and meticulous attention to detail. The result was a transformative change in our company's image.  Their dedication to ensuring our complete satisfaction was evident throughout the entire process, making it a smooth and enjoyable experience. I highly recommend Jesslin and her team to anyone in need of a skilled and reliable partner for branding projects. Their expertise and commitment to delivering exceptional results make them an invaluable asset to any organisation."* - Cheryl Chan, Director, Total Cleanz Pte Ltd.

*"Being a traditional jeweller who was looking to create a new sub-brand for a new market, we spoke to a few consulting and branding agencies that could possibly assist us with the brand transformation. Arnold was our first point of contact when we decided to embark on a branding exercise with Firefish. His experience and knowledge in branding convinced us that he is able to deliver a good job. We are pleased to have made that right choice.  Arnold and his team conducted in-depth interviews and focus groups with our key internal stakeholders to learn more about our company and culture before recommending solutions. He is patient and attentive and ensures that every internal stakeholder's views are heard. He guides us through the branding process from research to activation with detailed and timely reports. He is also actively involved throughout the whole process from managing the project and ensuring the work meets the objectives.  We are proud of our brand transformation and I highly recommend Arnold and his team to anyone who wants comprehensive and quality branding done."* - Jan Ho Hwee Shi, Executive Director, Ngee Soon Jewellery Pte Ltd.
