### Testimonials

*"Extends its gratitude to antics@play for their outstanding work. antics@play has been instrumental in planning for brand introduction of Polestar to Singapore. Besides studying market readiness, potential customers and consumption trends, antics@play also advised on correct usage of global assets, ensuring no copyright and IP infringements. The creative launch captured attention of the EV-curious audience during Polestar's Singapore launch. Events were well-attended and news of Polestar were covered in many news channels including The Straits Times and Business Times. The team also secured stories in the luxury press, enhancing Polestar's brand credibility and recognition. Working with the passionate and knowledgeable antics@play team has been a great experience, and Polestar looks forward to achieving even greater heights together."* - Adele Lee, General Manager, Wearnes Automotive Pte Ltd, Polestar Singapore

*"We appreciate your team's excellent work. Thanks to antics@play's diligent research, the branding job, supported by the government's Enterprise Development Grant (EDG), started strong and set us on the path to very fitting recommendations later on. Your team dove into the clean foods scene to grasp consumer trends, insights, and the industry's future and provided guidance on business strategy and road mapping.  Because of your thorough understanding of our business model, you were able to develop the overarching brand architecture that helped organize the different brands and make way for any of their future extensions. We were very satisfied with how the branding work turned out -- our brand positioning, nomenclature, identity, brand story, brand expressions, and brand guide are very much on point. We take our hats off your creativity.  Working with your team has been great, and we look forward to more projects together."* - Joseph Neo, Chief Marketing Officer, Wholesome Savour Pte Ltd

*"Working with antics@play was easier than I originally imagined. Despite being our first time engaging the agency, antics@play understood our brief almost immediately. The folks at antics@play made extra effort to understand the product, market sentiments, and came back with sound brand communications strategies. The resulting work from antics@play also received praises from our top management. The level of commitment towards our campaign by the team was admirable. Coupled with a good sense of trends, understanding of brief, they married both to achieve the best communications outcome."* - Katherine Ler, Regional Strategic Marketing Manager, Canon Singapore Pte Ltd
