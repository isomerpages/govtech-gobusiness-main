### Testimonials

*"In the process of founding and expanding our multinational company I learnt that quality is better than quantity. Few key people can make a huge difference to a business. I always give 100% in my job and I expect nothing less from my collaborators; internal and external. This is what I found when working with Wan Li: a top-down approach to complex IP licensing deals spanning multiple jurisdictions. Wan Li's commitment, professionalism, and skills are rare, and I cherish the relationship with her firm. Wan Li is my go-to person for all our corporate legal advice in APAC: from routine work to global IP licensing deals."* - Esprow
