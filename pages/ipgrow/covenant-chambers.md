His replies always had a personal touch and was willing to share his preliminary thoughts even though he wasn't appointed yet. We appointed Ronald for advisory and contract drafting. Throughout the engagement, he was very patient to incorporate our requirements and explaining the different legal terminologies. Overall, we made the right choice work engaging Ronald, and look forward to future engagements with him again. Kudos to Ronald & the team!"* - Mr L. Lim, Managing Partner.
