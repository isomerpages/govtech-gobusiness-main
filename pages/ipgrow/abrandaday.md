*"I started my branding journey with Nafe in 2016. Since then he has helped me on numerous branding matters for my company and some of my associate Companies too.     I trust Nafe with his sense and acumen. He always has it in him to understand what I want and recommend me the best branding strategy that works."* - Alan Chang, Managing Director, OA International Holdings.

*"I highly recommend ABrandADay for their exceptional branding and marketing services. With Nafe's contributions, they stand out for their creativity, innovation, and leadership. They consistently produce campaigns that resonate with audiences and push creative boundaries."* - Amos Chow, Business Manager, Yikowei.

*"As someone whose sole focus has been developing the best product for restaurant owners, it has been a journey learning how to tell our story. When Covid hit, there was a sudden surge in demand for F&B players to embark on digitalisation. I knew then that we had to do better in articulating our values. Nafe provided consultancy, laying the structure to navigate the critical period. He took the time to understand the business and our pain points."* - Jonathan Lim, Founder, The Oddle Company.
