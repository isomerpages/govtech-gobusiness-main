### Testimonials

*"I highly, highly, highly recommend Emily for branding and design work. If you are starting out and wondering if you should invest in proper branding, the answer is yes- do it as soon as you can. Emily's rebranding and design was a game changer for us -suddenly we look super professional and credible and can compete with the big names when it comes to attracting and winning business. I never dreamed I could afford top-notch branding as a start-up but Emily's packages meet you where you are at and add immediate value. Apart from being brilliant, she is also a wonderful, kind, funny and authentic individual you'll love working with."* - Helen Duce, CEO, Include Consulting Pte. Ltd.

*"I've had the pleasure of working with Emily and KOUSAH&CO for the last year, initially with her in a consulting capacity, but then more recently with her agency being appointed as our packaging partner.  More than most design agencies K&Co are able to really get 'under the hood' of the brief, delivering not just great work but insightful thinking behind it. Emily has been instrumental in a recent Global Visual Identity refresh, helping us to align diverse starting points and needs across multiple categories and markets in a coherent way.   Kousah&Co consistently impress with the flexibility and agility in responding to both strategic and practical challenges, punching well above their weight with the quality of work - which has held up to significant scrutiny both qualitatively and quantitatively in (global) markets.  .. Emily & team are fantastic to work with and true partners - have no hesitation in recommending them."* - Brent Whelan, General Manager Global Brands, Fonterra.

*"I had the good fortune to work with Emily and her team on our global re-branding strategy. Emily provided us with something beyond our expectations. The degree of professionalism, thoughtful process and continuous consultation was excellent. But what makes Emily and her team really stand out is their creative eye and the ability to create significant impact. She consulted with us to move past the ordinary to create something that evoked exactly what our brand was aiming for. I strongly recommend Emily and her team for any of your brand work. Simply put, they are outstanding."* - Saba Hasanie, Senior Partner & Managing Director, OSC Leadership Performance Pte. Ltd.
