### Tap on experienced mid-career individuals to enrich your workforce

As announced in Budget 2022, the SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme will be made a permanent programme to provide support to mature mid-career individuals aged 40 and above.

The SGUnited Mid-Career Pathways Programme is a full-time attachment programme which supports mature mid-career individuals aged 40 and above, to widen their professional networks and gain meaningful industry-relevant skills and experience. The attachments will last between four to six months.

### How you can benefit:

Host organisations can take on mature mid-career individuals (aged 40 and above) who bring with them a wealth of work experience on attachments. Upon completion of the attachment, host organisations are required to hire individuals as permanent employees as long as their performance is assessed to be satisfactory during the attachment.

---

### Subsidies and funding:

Trainees will receive a training allowance of up to $3,800 per month for the duration of the attachment. The approved monthly training allowance may vary depending on the scope of the attachment proposed by the host organisation. The Government co-funds the training allowance with the host organisation.

Monthly Training Allowance: $1,800 to $3,800
Government Funding: 70% of the training allowance

To encourage early conversion of trainees to full-time employees, host organisations will continue to receive training allowance subsidies from WSG for the converted trainees, if the trainee has completed at least three months of the attachment.
