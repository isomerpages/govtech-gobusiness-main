### Implement job redesign to become manpower lean while creating quality and meaningful careers in the Hotel Sector

The Initiative, which is a tripartite collaboration between WSG and STB, NTUC Hospitality and Consumer Business Cluster (NTUC HCBC), the Food Drinks and Allied Workers (FDAWU) and the Attractions, Resorts and Entertainment Union (AREU), as well as the Singapore Hotel Association (SHA), represents a key milestone in the overall transformation journey of the hotel sector.
