      content: |
        Since 8 May 2021 and to 13 June 2021, all indoor facilities including gyms and fitness studios, sports halls, indoor swimming pools, squash courts, are to close, **unless they only offer low intensity physical activities, sport and exercises where all participants and instructors are wearing masks at all times, and where there is no sharing or supply of any common equipment**.

        Participants, instructors and staff also have to adhere to a more stringent set of safe management measures (SMMs) per [Annex in the updated Sport Singapore guidance](https://go.gov.sg/furtherstrictersmm16mayto13june2021){:target="_blank"}. No such facility<sup>4</sup> will be allowed to offer weight, strength or resistance training of any form, and/or provide equipment for such training, as these are associated with strenuous activities.

        Other indoor facilities similar to gym and studio settings that remain in operation are to modify their activities to be in line with the more stringent SMM.

        <sup>4</sup>Premises identified as high-risk physical activities, sport and exercise environments include, but are not limited to, indoor fitness training facilities, indoor gyms, as well as fitness studios and similar indoor studio settings for climb walls, trampoline, dance, barre, spin, etc. Such indoor premises (and including any other type of indoor premises such as hotel, club or condominium function rooms) must not be allowed to be used, or hired out to others for use for any high intensity sport and physical activities where participants are in close contact, exerting and not wearing masks during the stipulated period.

    - title: What are some examples of low intensity sport/physical activities?
      content: |
        These are activities that can be done with mask on at all times such as Yoga, Pilates, stretching exercises, Tai Chi, etc. There may have to be some modification to how it is done, e.g. without the use of equipment, during this period of time.

    - title: I run a private sport academy (e.g. gymnastics, martial arts, combat sports) in an indoor setting similar to a studio. Do I need to close?
      content: |
        No, you don’t have to close but the activities being offered<sup>5</sup> will have to be modified as per the guidance below. You will also need to factor in the reduced group size and facility capacity, as well as enhanced measures as per [Annex in the updated Sport Singapore guidance](https://go.gov.sg/furtherstrictersmm16mayto13june2021){:target="_blank"}. These apply to activities such as TKD, MMA, Muay Thai, BJJ, Fencing, Judo, Boxing and other similar activities.

        The private sport academies who continue to open must:
        <br>- Modify your activities to minimise contact as much as possible. Keep total grappling time to no more than 15 minutes in total per session.
        <br>- Ensure that your participants and instructors are masked on at all times, refraining from conducting activities that are strenuous to the point that they feel the need to remove their masks.
        <br>- Not provide common equipment such as punching pads, bags, dummies, use of boxing ring, etc, where fomite transmission risk is high.
        <br>- Not offer weight, strength or resistance training or cardio training of any form, and/or provide equipment for such training, such that they become strenuous activities.
        <br>- Keep to cohorting to limit the extent of any contact tracing.

      content: |
        All indoor activities have to be changed to low intensity with masks on in a group of no more than 2 persons (i.e. 1v1). While practice drills may still be possible, competitive sports will typically be high intensity and if allowed to proceed would put participants at risk of flouting the law. Therefore, we advise venue operators to ensure that competitive sports do not take place and masks are worn at all times. ActiveSG may disallow competitive sports to take place at its venues.

      content: |
        High intensity activities are only allowed in settings that are not similar to indoor gyms/studios (e.g. outdoors or large halls). These classes are commonly held based on cohorting (same class time, same participants, same venue etc) and this generally limits the risk exposure to the same cohort. However, if these classes are held in settings similar to gym/studios, they will need to modify their activities as per the guidance below, and factor in the reduced group size and facility capacity, as well as enhanced measures as per Annex in the updated Sport Singapore guidance. These apply to activities such as TKD, MMA, Muay Thai, BJJ, Fencing, Judo, Boxing and other similar activities.

        The operators whose classes are held in settings similar to gyms/studios must:
        <br>- Modify your activities to minimise contact as much as possible. Keep total grappling time to no more than 15 minutes in total per session.
        <br>- Ensure that your participants and instructors are masked on at all times, refraining from conducting activities that are strenuous to the point that they feel the need to remove their masks.
        <br>- Not provide common equipment such as punching pads, bags, dummies, use of boxing ring, etc, where fomite transmission risk is high.
        <br>- Not offer weight, strength or resistance training or cardio training of any form, and/or provide equipment for such training, such that they become strenuous activities.
