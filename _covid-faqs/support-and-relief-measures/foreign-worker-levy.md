      The Government announced on 27 June 2020 that it will set aside up to $920 million to extend Foreign Worker Levy (FWL) rebates for the Construction, Marine Shipyard and Process sectors till end 2022. This will better support the estimated 15,000 companies in these sectors adjust to much more stringent Safe Management Measures as a result of COVID-19.

      Companies in these sectors will receive a $90 FWL rebate monthly for each Work Permit Holder from August 2020 till December 2021. This is in addition to the 100% FWL waiver and $750 FWL rebate in June, and the 50% FWL waiver and $375 FWL in July, which applies to all companies that are unable to restart work. The Government will review this closer to December 2021 and decide if there is a need to further extend the FWL rebate by another year to December 2022.
