  - title: If my business is not allowed to resume operation, can I go to my place of business to perform maintenance of the facility, attend to perishable products, receive deliveries or perform other necessary tasks?

      You may go to your business location for a short duration to take care of crucial tasks that cannot be done remotely or to retrieve necessary materials or documents even if your business is not allowed to resume operations.  

      Your employees are not permitted to go to your place of business. They may work remotely from home.

      If you need to activate your employees to work on-site for short periods of time (i.e. less than a day), you need to apply for a time-limited exemption. Please submit your application **one day before** the required date of use.

      If you need to maintain a small workforce at your place of business for safety purposes, please apply for a general exemption.

  - title: If I see a non-permitted business continue to operate even though it is not supposed to, what should I do?
    content: |
      Please report this business and provide relevant details such as its name, address and relevant evidence (e.g. photographs) to <covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg>.
