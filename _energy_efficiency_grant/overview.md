The Energy Efficiency Grant (EEG) was launched September 2022 and aims to help businesses within the Food Services, Food Manufacturing or Retail sectors to cope with rising energy costs, through co-funding investments in more energy efficient equipment.

It provides financial support for SMEs to adopt pre-approved energy efficient equipment in the following categories: LED lighting, air-conditioners, cooking hobs, refrigerators, water heaters and clothes dryers.

**Note:**

- From 1 Sep 2022 to 31 Mar 2024, companies will be able to submit applications for the purchase of energy efficient equipment through the Business Grants Portal (BGP).

- Companies will have up to 1 year from the time an application is approved to purchase and install the equipment and submit claims for reimbursement. Once an application has been submitted, companies may choose to proceed to purchase the equipment before the application outcome. However, companies will not be able to claim subsequently if the application is unsuccessful.

- This pre-approved energy efficient equipment listing is not to be taken as a form of endorsement or recommendation by the participating government agencies. Companies are reminded to carry out due diligence when engaging vendors, and not to share their Corppass with the vendors to carry out submission of any grant applications or claims.
