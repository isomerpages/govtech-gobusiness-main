### Overview - Energy Efficiency Grant (EEG)

The Energy Efficiency Grant (EEG) aims to support businesses in their sustainability journey by co-funding investment in energy-efficient (EE) equipment.
 
The EEG will provide two tiers of support:

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Advanced Tier*</td>
    <td>Up to S$350,000 across Base and Advanced Tiers</td>
    <td>EE equipment need not be pre-approved, but must demonstrate energy savings above 350tonnes lifetime carbon abatement</td>
    <td>Lower of:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Support levels under the Base Tier; or</li>
    <li>Grant quantum computed based on EE equipment's expected lifetime energy savings</li>

</table>

<u><b>Note about Base Tier</b></u> 

Companies will have up to <b>1 year</b> from the time an application is approved to purchase and install the equipment and submit claims for reimbursement. 

Once an application has been submitted, companies may purchase the equipment before the application outcome. However, companies will not be able to claim subsequently if the application is unsuccessful.
