Workplaces specified as factories under the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Act, must either notify or register their activities with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) before starting operations.

If your factory engages in high-risk activities, you will have to apply for a Certificate of Registration.

If your factory engages in low-risk activities, you will have to submit a one-time Factory Notification declaring your activities.

If your factory falls under the definition of Major Hazard Installation (MHI), you are required to register the premises as an MHI with MOM, at least 6 months before operations.

From 1 April 2019, construction worksites are not required to be registered with MOM.
