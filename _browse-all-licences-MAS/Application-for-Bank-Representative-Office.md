<H3>Application Details</H3>

<p>Bank representative offices are registered under section 13A of the Banking Act (Cap. 19). A bank representative office may carry out liaison work, market research or feasibility studies, but is not allowed to transact any business in Singapore. The registration of a bank representative office does not imply that the applicant will qualify for a banking licence in future.</p>
