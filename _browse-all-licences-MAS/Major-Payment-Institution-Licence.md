<H3>Application Details</H3>

<p>Major payment institutions are licensed and regulated under the <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/acts/payment-services-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Payment Services Act ("PS Act")</a> to provide payment services without being subject to the specified thresholds.</p>
<p>The thresholds are set out in section 6(5) of the PS Act. In summary, these are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>S$3 million monthly transactions for any payment service (other than electronic money (e-money) account issuance and money-changing services).</li>
    <li>S$6 million monthly transactions for two or more payment services (other than e-money account issuance and money-changing services).</li>
    <li>S$5 million of daily outstanding e-money</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that entities that provide only money-changing services should apply for a money-changing licence instead. Entities that provide payment services below the specified thresholds should apply for a standard payment institution licence.</p>
